      "By Dustin Rowles | Film | January 2, 2024 | \n",
      "JANUARY 2, 2025 — While 2023 was the best year at the box office since the pandemic, unfortunately, the Hollywood strikes of that year took their toll on 2024, which essentially matched the overall box office numbers of 2023, give or take $50 million. That’s not bad, considering there was no Taylor Swift to save the year. The 2023 lessons of Barbie and Oppenheimer had not yet taken hold, either, so the entire top ten is nothing but sequels, prequels, spin-offs, and reboots, but a few filmmakers (Barry Jenkins and Lee Isaac Chung, in particular) took some risks that paid off both in terms of creativity and box-office. \n",
      "Here are the year’s top-grossing films: \n",
      "Mufasa: Lion King — Disney has not had a great couple of years, and audiences have grown weary of live-action remakes. Nevertheless, audiences flocked over the holidays to see the prequel to a live-action remake directed by none other than Barry Jenkins, who gave the picture a huge heart to go along with big laughs provided by the voices of Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner. The studio may have some ups and downs, but at the end of the day, Disney is gonna Disney. (Domestic: $365 million; Worldwide; $1.3 billion)\n",
      "Despicable Me 4 — We almost hate to see the 6th film in a tired franchise finish so high at the year’s box office, but the kids never tire of Gru and Co., which kept kids in theaters around the world during the hot summer months of July and August. It was a fine movie; adults could tolerate it, and it was a real crowd-pleaser for those under 9. There are worse things (see, e.g. Ryan Reynolds’ imaginary friend flick, If). (Domestic: $350 million; Worldwide: $1.1 billion)\n",
      "Twisters — Sliding into the same weekend as last year’s Barbie and Oppenheimer, Lee Isaac Chung’s (Minari) Twister sequel had the scale of a giant blockbuster but the heavy themes of an eco-thriller, which hit particularly hard this year in the midst of the hottest summer on record. No one, however, was hotter than Glen Powell, who finally broke into the A-list by starring in the unexpected blockbuster hit of the year. (Domestic: $300 million; Global: $850 million)\n",
      "Inside Out 2 — Pixar smartly limited itself to one release in 2024, which just happened to be a sequel to one of the studio’s three best films. Kelsey Mann, in his feature debut, managed to capture most of the magic of the original (despite the lack of Bing Bong, or the voices of Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling). It’s hard to know what it means for the future of Pixar, but Inside Out 2 recaptured some of its lost mojo. (Domestic: $287 million; Worldwide: $789 million)\n",
      "Fall Guy — Building on the success of Barbie, Ryan Gosling joined forces with Emily Blunt and director David Leitch (John Wick) to give us a much-needed old-school action comedy that succeeded less because of the IP (no one even remembers the Fall Guy TV series) and more because of old-fashioned star power, a very funny script, and some spectacular action sequences. (Domestic: $320 million; Global: $785 million)\n",
      "Deadpool 3 — Save for Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe, superhero films largely took a break in 2024, proving to be a boon for Deadpool 3, which teamed Ryan Reynolds with Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine. Yes, it was too self-referential and a little too overstuffed with inside jokes, but the cameos were fun as hell, and the film itself was a blast. It did not leave an indelible mark or change the superhero genre for the better in any meaningful way, but it was wildly entertaining. (Domestic: $265 million; Worldwide: $732 million) \n",
      "Gladiator 2 — There was a huge question mark about whether audiences would show up for a swords-and-sandals sequel to a 24-year-old film starring an actor (Paul Mescal) little-known outside of indie films coming from a prolific 87-year-old director whose better days were perhaps behind him, but hell if Ridley Scott didn’t pull it off. It helps to have Pedro Pascal and Denzel Washington join the cast, but it was also a great film, and every dad in America answered its siren call. (Domestic: $230 million; Global: $510 million). \n",
      "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga — The Fury Road prequel did not quite match the intensity of the Charlize Theron entry, but never count out George Miller, who still provided audiences with a lot of huge thrills, some outstanding visuals, and an ending we will not soon forget. It won’t go down as one of the ten best movies of the decade, but it did manage to outgross its predecessor. (Domestic: $175 million; Global: $450 million). \n",
      "Ballerina — You’d think that audiences might tire of the John Wick franchise, but Ballerina managed to freshen up the film franchise by turning its focus on a new character played by Ana de Armas, a welcome addition, although Len Wiseman’s direction often left something to be desired. (Domestic: $187 million; Worldwide: $440 million). \n",
      "Beetlejuice 2 — While Gladiator had twenty-four years between sequels, Beetlejuice really upped that gap with 36 years in between. Tim Burton has lost his touch, and the film was something of a mediocre mess, but Jenna Ortega brought in a young audience while older folks returned to see Michael Keaton reprise his role and also to see how bloody fantastic Winona Ryder looks all these years later. (Domestic: $155 million; Worldwide: $400 million)\n",
      "Flops\n",
      "Ghostbusters: Frozen — Jason Reitman’s Ghostbusters: Afterworld was better than most expected, and it was fun to bring the old gang back for an extended cameo, but no one asked for this. There was actually too much of the original cast, and it was another one of those “What are you doing, Carrie Coon?” roles. It was a terrible movie (27 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) that not even Paul Rudd and Ernie Hudson’s combined charm could save. (Domestic: $74 million; Worldwide: $201 million)\n",
      "Madame Web — Before the superhero genre could rebound from its terrible 2023, it first had to hit bottom. Madame Web was the bottom. Kraven the Hunter was better (and Venom 3 was pushed to 2025), but Madame Web was Morbius levels of bad, and it wasn’t even funny to hate it. (Domestic: $59 million; Worldwide: $121 million)\n",
      "Horizon: An American Saga — Warner Brothers took a big risk on Kevin Costner’s costly two-part Western, and boy did it backfire. People love to see Kevin Costner in Westerns on TV, but trying to lure dads out of their houses to see not one but two films in a six-week span was too much to ask. Everyone always complains about what a bomb Waterworld was, but that film actually made money. These two films — which cost $200 million combined — decidedly did not, in part because there was no global audience for it. (Horizon: An American Saga Part I: Domestic: $39 million; $51 million worldwide; Part I1: Domestic: $22 million; Worldwide: $34 million). \n",
      "Transformers One — The live-action franchise had already run out of steam after seven Transformers films, and no one was asking for an animated prequel, even one voiced by actors Channing Tatum, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, and Jon Hamm. It didn’t help that the script was uninspired and the animation was boring. (Domestic: $47 million; Worldwide: $112 million). \n",
      "Wicked — Musicals had a small comeback at the end of 2023 with The Color Purple and in January with Mean Girls ($127 million domestic), but the audience for John Chu’s big-budget theatrical release of Wicked did not materialize. Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater’s break-up didn’t help matters, but the biggest problem with the film is that it just wasn’t that good. I can’t believe there’s still a part two to come next year. (Domestic: $54 million; Worldwide: $178 million). \n",

The past few years have been all about recovering from the pandemic. Now? Hollywood and theater chains are facing the challenge of weathering a year that has been crippled by 2023's Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild of America strikes. There have been moments worth cheering about, such as the success of \"Dune: Part Two.\" But, as always, there have been plenty of sour moments at the box office as well, with more than a few flops to go along with the hits.The early part of the year was anchored by relatively smaller hits like director David Ayer's \"The Beekeeper\" and the \"Mean Girls\" musical. Mixed in along the way were a wide variety of misfires, from hopeful big studio blockbusters to smaller, original movies just trying to find their way in an uncertain theatrical landscape.

      "According to Box Office Mojo, the 2023 summer movie season, backed by strong releases, grossed $4.03 billion in ticket sales, accounting for 45% of the domestic box office total of $8.9 billion. It marked the first time since the pre-pandemic era that the summer domestic box office exceeded $4 billion. In 2023, there were 13 summer movies released that grossed over $100 million in ticket sales led by Barbie ($636.2 million) and the sequel Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse ($381.3 million).\n",

      "As a result, industry analysts forecast this summer will account for about 38% of the annual box office. The anticipated lackluster summer movie season comes on the heels of a dreary first four months of 2024. From January to April, domestic box office tallied about $2 billion in ticket sales, running about 20% lower than last year.\n",
      "From 2007 to 2019 the domestic box office had exceeded $4 billion every year with the exception of 2017. The summer box office reached a high-water mark in 2013 when ticket sales reached $4.75 billion. To date, the highest grossing summer movie was Paramount’s\n",

      "2016 — $4.49\n",
      "One reason for a lower projected summer box office season is the two lengthy work stoppages has backed up the release dates for films. For example, with the exception of one film, Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe has pushed back the release date of every film originally slated for 2024 to next year. Because of the two strikes, Paramount moved the release date of Mission Impossible 8 (working title) a number of times, most recently from June 28, 2024 to Memorial Day weekend next year.\n",
      "According to the Associated Press, this summer there will be 32 wide releases, the same amount of 2023, but lower than the usual number in the years prior to Covid-19 which had typically been over 40. The dearth of releases is not going unnoticed.\n",
      "NBCU Studio Group chair Donna Langley, in an interview with Deadline, commented about this summer movie season said, \"We need volume to come back, we need more movies.\"\n",
      "The 2024 summer season began inauspiciously. With the exception of the pandemic years, since 2009, the opening weekend of the summer movie season began with a release from Marvel. Last November, Disney pushed back the release date of Deadpool & Wolverine from May 3 to July 26.\n",
      "Since 2009, all but two Marvel movies opened the summer season with a film grossing over $100 million. Industry analysts forecast Deadpool & Wolverine, the lone Marvel summer release and the studios first “R” rated movie, will, in the first four weeks, generate $350 million in domestic box office, potentially becoming the top grossing film of the summer.\n",
      "As a result of Marvel changing its release schedule, Universal’s The Fall Guy was moved from a March 1 release date to May 3, kicking-off the summer. Based on the television series starring Lee Majors, The Fall Guy, headlined by Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt (from “Barbenheimer”), grossed a disappointing $28.5 million in the opening weekend. The movie had been projected to have a $40 million opening weekend.\n",
      "By comparison in 2023, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 opened at $118.4 million. Ticket sales for The Fall Guy continued to be lackluster, the film became available for home streaming on May 21 ahead of schedule.\n",
      "The top movie release of the following weekend was the sequel Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, domestically grossing $58.5 million. For the weekend of May 17, IF, a holiday-type film from Ryan Reynolds, which had been pushed back from last Thanksgiving, was top grossing at $35 million.\n",
      "The top grossing movie on Memorial Day weekend is expected to be the sequel Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, or possibly The Garfield Movie. Neither film is forecast to top $100 million over the holiday. Hence, May will be bereft of any $100 million opening weekend.\n",
      "Ticket sales for June may also be sluggish. The top grossing movies are expected to be Sony’s Bad Boys: Ride or Die and Pixar’s Inside Out 2. July should get a boost from Twisters a sequel from Universal and Illumination’s Despicable Me 4. The animated sequel should compete with Deadpool and Wolverine as the top grossing film of summer.\n",
      "Another factor impacting the summer season is streaming video. As audiences continue to migrate to streaming, the video platform is competing directly with theatrically released films this summer. This summer most streaming films, headlined by familiar names, will be coming from such non-traditional Hollywood studios as Netflix\n",

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m### Title: \"The Biggest Box Office Flops of 2024: A Year Hollywood Would Rather Forget\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Introduction\n",
      "2024 has been a turbulent year for Hollywood, reeling from the effects of the previous year's actors' and writers' strikes. Even with the excitement of new releases, some films have faced disastrous box office performances. This blog post delves into the biggest box office flops of 2024, examining their financial losses, critical reception, and reasons behind their poor performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire\n",
      "**Box Office Earnings:** Domestic: $74 million; Worldwide: $201 million  \n",
      "**Production Costs:** Estimated at $150 million  \n",
      "**Critical Reception:** 27% on Rotten Tomatoes, mostly negative reviews  \n",
      "**Notable Reasons for Poor Performance:**  \n",
      "The sequel to \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife,\" \"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,\" was criticized for its over-reliance on the original cast, leading to a film that felt more like a nostalgia trip than a fresh take. Even the charms of Paul Rudd and Ernie Hudson couldn't save it from its fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Madame Web\n",
      "**Box Office Earnings:** Domestic: $59 million; Worldwide: $121 million  \n",
      "**Production Costs:** Estimated at $100 million  \n",
      "**Critical Reception:** Universally panned, often compared to \"Morbius\"  \n",
      "**Notable Reasons for Poor Performance:**  \n",
      "\"Madame Web\" marked the low point for the superhero genre in 2024. Critics and audiences alike found it lackluster, contributing to its disastrous box office performance. The film failed to capitalize on its comic book origins, offering neither compelling storytelling nor engaging characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Horizon: An American Saga Part I & II\n",
      "**Box Office Earnings:**  \n",
      "- Part I: Domestic: $39 million; Worldwide: $51 million  \n",
      "- Part II: Domestic: $22 million; Worldwide: $34 million  \n",
      "**Production Costs:** $200 million combined  \n",
      "**Critical Reception:** Mixed to negative  \n",
      "**Notable Reasons for Poor Performance:**  \n",
      "Kevin Costner's ambitious two-part Western saga was a significant misstep for Warner Brothers. While Costner's name might attract TV audiences, it failed to pull in moviegoers. The dual-release strategy backfired, and the films couldn't find a global audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Transformers One\n",
      "**Box Office Earnings:** Domestic: $47 million; Worldwide: $112 million  \n",
      "**Production Costs:** Estimated at $150 million  \n",
      "**Critical Reception:** Poor, criticized for uninspired script and animation  \n",
      "**Notable Reasons for Poor Performance:**  \n",
      "The \"Transformers\" franchise had already lost steam, and this animated prequel did little to rejuvenate it. Despite a star-studded voice cast, the film's lackluster animation and weak script led to its downfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Wicked\n",
      "**Box Office Earnings:** Domestic: $54 million; Worldwide: $178 million  \n",
      "**Production Costs:** Estimated at $100 million  \n",
      "**Critical Reception:** Mixed to negative  \n",
      "**Notable Reasons for Poor Performance:**  \n",
      "Despite the success of other musicals, \"Wicked\" couldn't find its footing. The off-screen drama between stars Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater didn't help, but the primary issue was the film's inability to capture the magic of its stage predecessor.\n",

The past few years have been all about recovering from the pandemic. Now? Hollywood and theater chains are facing the challenge of weathering a year that has been crippled by 2023's Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild of America strikes. There have been moments worth cheering about, such as the success of \"Dune: Part Two.\" But, as always, there have been plenty of sour moments at the box office as well, with more than a few flops to go along with the hits.The early part of the year was anchored by relatively smaller hits like director David Ayer's \"The Beekeeper\" and the \"Mean Girls\" musical. Mixed in along the way were a wide variety of misfires, from hopeful big studio blockbusters to smaller, original movies just trying to find their way in an uncertain theatrical landscape.

      "JANUARY 2, 2025 — While 2023 was the best year at the box office since the pandemic, unfortunately, the Hollywood strikes of that year took their toll on 2024, which essentially matched the overall box office numbers of 2023, give or take $50 million. That’s not bad, considering there was no Taylor Swift to save the year. The 2023 lessons of Barbie and Oppenheimer had not yet taken hold, either, so the entire top ten is nothing but sequels, prequels, spin-offs, and reboots, but a few filmmakers (Barry Jenkins and Lee Isaac Chung, in particular) took some risks that paid off both in terms of creativity and box-office. \n",
      "Here are the year’s top-grossing films: \n",
      "Mufasa: Lion King — Disney has not had a great couple of years, and audiences have grown weary of live-action remakes. Nevertheless, audiences flocked over the holidays to see the prequel to a live-action remake directed by none other than Barry Jenkins, who gave the picture a huge heart to go along with big laughs provided by the voices of Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner. The studio may have some ups and downs, but at the end of the day, Disney is gonna Disney. (Domestic: $365 million; Worldwide; $1.3 billion)\n",
      "Despicable Me 4 — We almost hate to see the 6th film in a tired franchise finish so high at the year’s box office, but the kids never tire of Gru and Co., which kept kids in theaters around the world during the hot summer months of July and August. It was a fine movie; adults could tolerate it, and it was a real crowd-pleaser for those under 9. There are worse things (see, e.g. Ryan Reynolds’ imaginary friend flick, If). (Domestic: $350 million; Worldwide: $1.1 billion)\n",
      "Twisters — Sliding into the same weekend as last year’s Barbie and Oppenheimer, Lee Isaac Chung’s (Minari) Twister sequel had the scale of a giant blockbuster but the heavy themes of an eco-thriller, which hit particularly hard this year in the midst of the hottest summer on record. No one, however, was hotter than Glen Powell, who finally broke into the A-list by starring in the unexpected blockbuster hit of the year. (Domestic: $300 million; Global: $850 million)\n",
      "Inside Out 2 — Pixar smartly limited itself to one release in 2024, which just happened to be a sequel to one of the studio’s three best films. Kelsey Mann, in his feature debut, managed to capture most of the magic of the original (despite the lack of Bing Bong, or the voices of Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling). It’s hard to know what it means for the future of Pixar, but Inside Out 2 recaptured some of its lost mojo. (Domestic: $287 million; Worldwide: $789 million)\n",
      "Fall Guy — Building on the success of Barbie, Ryan Gosling joined forces with Emily Blunt and director David Leitch (John Wick) to give us a much-needed old-school action comedy that succeeded less because of the IP (no one even remembers the Fall Guy TV series) and more because of old-fashioned star power, a very funny script, and some spectacular action sequences. (Domestic: $320 million; Global: $785 million)\n",
      "Deadpool 3 — Save for Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe, superhero films largely took a break in 2024, proving to be a boon for Deadpool 3, which teamed Ryan Reynolds with Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine. Yes, it was too self-referential and a little too overstuffed with inside jokes, but the cameos were fun as hell, and the film itself was a blast. It did not leave an indelible mark or change the superhero genre for the better in any meaningful way, but it was wildly entertaining. (Domestic: $265 million; Worldwide: $732 million) \n",
      "Gladiator 2 — There was a huge question mark about whether audiences would show up for a swords-and-sandals sequel to a 24-year-old film starring an actor (Paul Mescal) little-known outside of indie films coming from a prolific 87-year-old director whose better days were perhaps behind him, but hell if Ridley Scott didn’t pull it off. It helps to have Pedro Pascal and Denzel Washington join the cast, but it was also a great film, and every dad in America answered its siren call. (Domestic: $230 million; Global: $510 million). \n",
      "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga — The Fury Road prequel did not quite match the intensity of the Charlize Theron entry, but never count out George Miller, who still provided audiences with a lot of huge thrills, some outstanding visuals, and an ending we will not soon forget. It won’t go down as one of the ten best movies of the decade, but it did manage to outgross its predecessor. (Domestic: $175 million; Global: $450 million). \n",
      "Ballerina — You’d think that audiences might tire of the John Wick franchise, but Ballerina managed to freshen up the film franchise by turning its focus on a new character played by Ana de Armas, a welcome addition, although Len Wiseman’s direction often left something to be desired. (Domestic: $187 million; Worldwide: $440 million). \n",
      "Beetlejuice 2 — While Gladiator had twenty-four years between sequels, Beetlejuice really upped that gap with 36 years in between. Tim Burton has lost his touch, and the film was something of a mediocre mess, but Jenna Ortega brought in a young audience while older folks returned to see Michael Keaton reprise his role and also to see how bloody fantastic Winona Ryder looks all these years later. (Domestic: $155 million; Worldwide: $400 million)\n",
      "Flops\n",
      "Ghostbusters: Frozen — Jason Reitman’s Ghostbusters: Afterworld was better than most expected, and it was fun to bring the old gang back for an extended cameo, but no one asked for this. There was actually too much of the original cast, and it was another one of those “What are you doing, Carrie Coon?” roles. It was a terrible movie (27 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) that not even Paul Rudd and Ernie Hudson’s combined charm could save. (Domestic: $74 million; Worldwide: $201 million)\n",
      "Madame Web — Before the superhero genre could rebound from its terrible 2023, it first had to hit bottom. Madame Web was the bottom. Kraven the Hunter was better (and Venom 3 was pushed to 2025), but Madame Web was Morbius levels of bad, and it wasn’t even funny to hate it. (Domestic: $59 million; Worldwide: $121 million)\n",
      "Horizon: An American Saga — Warner Brothers took a big risk on Kevin Costner’s costly two-part Western, and boy did it backfire. People love to see Kevin Costner in Westerns on TV, but trying to lure dads out of their houses to see not one but two films in a six-week span was too much to ask. Everyone always complains about what a bomb Waterworld was, but that film actually made money. These two films — which cost $200 million combined — decidedly did not, in part because there was no global audience for it. (Horizon: An American Saga Part I: Domestic: $39 million; $51 million worldwide; Part I1: Domestic: $22 million; Worldwide: $34 million). \n",
      "Transformers One — The live-action franchise had already run out of steam after seven Transformers films, and no one was asking for an animated prequel, even one voiced by actors Channing Tatum, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, and Jon Hamm. It didn’t help that the script was uninspired and the animation was boring. (Domestic: $47 million; Worldwide: $112 million). \n",
      "Wicked — Musicals had a small comeback at the end of 2023 with The Color Purple and in January with Mean Girls ($127 million domestic), but the audience for John Chu’s big-budget theatrical release of Wicked did not materialize. Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater’s break-up didn’t help matters, but the biggest problem with the film is that it just wasn’t that good. I can’t believe there’s still a part two to come next year. (Domestic: $54 million; Worldwide: $178 million). \n",

      "For Hollywood summer is one of the important seasons of the year. The season starts with the first weekend in May and concludes on Labor Day — lasting for 123 days, making it range from May 3 to September 2. Typically, summer releases account for roughly 40% of the annual domestic box office.\n",
      "According to Box Office Mojo, the 2023 summer movie season, backed by strong releases, grossed $4.03 billion in ticket sales, accounting for 45% of the domestic box office total of $8.9 billion. It marked the first time since the pre-pandemic era that the summer domestic box office exceeded $4 billion. In 2023, there were 13 summer movies released that grossed over $100 million in ticket sales led by Barbie ($636.2 million) and the sequel Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse ($381.3 million).\n",

      " projects the summer movie box office could be as much as $800 million below last year’s total. Gower Street, a movie analytics company, forecasts this summer’s domestic box office to total $3.3 billion, with the chance it could be higher.\n",
      "As a result, industry analysts forecast this summer will account for about 38% of the annual box office. The anticipated lackluster summer movie season comes on the heels of a dreary first four months of 2024. From January to April, domestic box office tallied about $2 billion in ticket sales, running about 20% lower than last year.\n",
      "From 2007 to 2019 the domestic box office had exceeded $4 billion every year with the exception of 2017. The summer box office reached a high-water mark in 2013 when ticket sales reached $4.75 billion. To date, the highest grossing summer movie was Paramount’s\n",

      "2016 — $4.49\n",
      "One reason for a lower projected summer box office season is the two lengthy work stoppages has backed up the release dates for films. For example, with the exception of one film, Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe has pushed back the release date of every film originally slated for 2024 to next year. Because of the two strikes, Paramount moved the release date of Mission Impossible 8 (working title) a number of times, most recently from June 28, 2024 to Memorial Day weekend next year.\n",
      "According to the Associated Press, this summer there will be 32 wide releases, the same amount of 2023, but lower than the usual number in the years prior to Covid-19 which had typically been over 40. The dearth of releases is not going unnoticed.\n",
      "NBCU Studio Group chair Donna Langley, in an interview with Deadline, commented about this summer movie season said, \"We need volume to come back, we need more movies.\"\n",
      "The 2024 summer season began inauspiciously. With the exception of the pandemic years, since 2009, the opening weekend of the summer movie season began with a release from Marvel. Last November, Disney pushed back the release date of Deadpool & Wolverine from May 3 to July 26.\n",
      "Since 2009, all but two Marvel movies opened the summer season with a film grossing over $100 million. Industry analysts forecast Deadpool & Wolverine, the lone Marvel summer release and the studios first “R” rated movie, will, in the first four weeks, generate $350 million in domestic box office, potentially becoming the top grossing film of the summer.\n",
      "As a result of Marvel changing its release schedule, Universal’s The Fall Guy was moved from a March 1 release date to May 3, kicking-off the summer. Based on the television series starring Lee Majors, The Fall Guy, headlined by Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt (from “Barbenheimer”), grossed a disappointing $28.5 million in the opening weekend. The movie had been projected to have a $40 million opening weekend.\n",
      "By comparison in 2023, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 opened at $118.4 million. Ticket sales for The Fall Guy continued to be lackluster, the film became available for home streaming on May 21 ahead of schedule.\n",
      "The top movie release of the following weekend was the sequel Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, domestically grossing $58.5 million. For the weekend of May 17, IF, a holiday-type film from Ryan Reynolds, which had been pushed back from last Thanksgiving, was top grossing at $35 million.\n",
      "The top grossing movie on Memorial Day weekend is expected to be the sequel Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, or possibly The Garfield Movie. Neither film is forecast to top $100 million over the holiday. Hence, May will be bereft of any $100 million opening weekend.\n",
      "Ticket sales for June may also be sluggish. The top grossing movies are expected to be Sony’s Bad Boys: Ride or Die and Pixar’s Inside Out 2. July should get a boost from Twisters a sequel from Universal and Illumination’s Despicable Me 4. The animated sequel should compete with Deadpool and Wolverine as the top grossing film of summer.\n",
      "Another factor impacting the summer season is streaming video. As audiences continue to migrate to streaming, the video platform is competing directly with theatrically released films this summer. This summer most streaming films, headlined by familiar names, will be coming from such non-traditional Hollywood studios as Netflix\n",

      "\tMatthew Vaughn’s “Argylle” has become the first major box office flop of 2024. The action-comedy, backed by Apple and distributed by Universal Pictures, only opened to $17 million during its domestic debut and might not even make it to $100 million worldwide by the end of its run. For a $200 million production that boasts a star-studded cast with Henry Cavill, John Cena, Dua Lipa, Samuel L. Jackson and more, these box office numbers are more or less disastrous. Negative reviews (the film holds a 32% from 255 reviews) surely didn’t help make “Argylle” a must-see for audiences. The film joins a long list of Hollywood misfires, but they are not all created equally. In many unfortunate cases, even great films become box office flops. \n",
      "\tNo wonder Martin Scorsese went viral several years ago for railing against the industry’s obsession with box office numbers, particularly Hollywood’s tendency to judge films based on the strength of their opening weekend grosses. \n",
      "\t“Since the ’80s, there’s been a focus on numbers. It’s kind of repulsive,” Scorsese once said. “The cost of a movie is one thing. Understand that a film costs a certain amount, they expect to at least get the amount back… The emphasis is now on numbers, cost, the opening weekend, how much it made in the U.S.A., how much it made in England, how much it made in Asia, how much it made in the entire world, how many viewers it got. As a filmmaker, and as a person who can’t imagine life without cinema, I always find it really insulting.”\n",
      "\tEdgar Wright is another major who has taken a stance against box office valuation in recent years, once telling fans, “The three-day weekend is not the end of the story for any movie. People shouldn’t buy into that idea. Rating films by their box office is like the football fan equivalent to films. Most of my favorite films that are considered classics today were not considered hits in their time.”\n",
      "\tEven Christopher Nolan recently told the AP that you can’t judge a film in weekends. “I know for myself the life of the movie is a much longer proposition in that, you look at other people’s films and indeed your own films in decades, not in weekends,” he said. “I think the science fiction genre is the one where the long view is everything. People revisit. They value science fiction in a very long-term way. The original ‘Blade Runner,’ nobody paid any attention to it on release, it was famously a flop. Then over time, people like myself (found it). I think I was 13 when I first saw a VHS tape.”\n",
      "\tThese acclaimed filmmakers certainly have a point, as many of the most critically acclaimed films this century got their starts as box office flops. Be it “Children of Men” or “The Master” or “Under the Skin,” it’s become abundantly clear that you can’t judge a movie by its gross. Below, Variety offers a selection of great films that flopped at the box office.\n",
      "Killers of the Flower Moon\n",

      "\tThere is a lingering debate taking place about whether or not Apple Original Films is flopping or not. It’s more clear in the case of “Argylle” (see above), but Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” cleared its own $200 million budget with $219 million worldwide, but not by too much. As for Martin Scorsese’s masterful “Killers of the Flower Moon,” it only grossed $67 million domestically and $156 million worldwide on a $200 million budget. Those numbers are certainly strong for an R-rated movie that runs well over the three-hour mark, but it was far from being profitable in theaters due to its inflated budget. Apple is a tech giant, of course, so the lines on what is hit-or-miss at the box office are blurred as it doesn’t place the same emphasis on box office as it does on streaming subscribers. But if a traditional studio released “Killers of the Flower Moon,” it would be branded a huge flop.\n",
      "Beau Is Afraid \n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n",
      "\tAri Aster’s “Beau Is Afraid” is one of A24’s biggest flops, as it only grossed $11 million worldwide on a production budget estimated to be in the $35 million range. Aster’s directorial debut “Hereditary” was a monster hit for A24 with $82 million worldwide, while follow-up “Midsommar” turned in $48 million worldwide on a reported budget of $10 million. The third time wasn’t the charm for the visionary director, who divided moviegoers with his Joaquin Phoenix-starring odyssey about an anxiety-raddled man who ventures home to see his mother. It’s an audacious three-hour epic full of narrative gambles that pay off, stumble and confound. Sometimes all at the same time. It’s worth a try, and perhaps the film’s shelf life on Paramount+ With Showtime is attracting for fans.\n",

      "\tDespite rave reviews and being based on Judy Blume’s beloved novel, writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig’s film adaptation of “Are You There God? It’s Me Margaret” flopped at the box office with $21 million worldwide on a $30 million budget. It’s a shame because the movie is such a winning delight. Craig brings the funny, flawed and all-too-realistic Margaret to the screen exactly as she is on Blume’s pages, and the young Abby Ryder Fortson’s effervescence in the lead role is infectious. McAdams rightfully became an Oscar dark horse for supporting actress (no nomination, alas!) and picked up many critic’s group prizes for her performance as Margaret’s mother Barbara, who gets an expanded role in the film as she struggles to adjust to being a stay-at-home mom.\n",

      "\t“Dumb Money” failed at the box office last fall with $13 million domestically and just $20 million worldwide, a big disappointment for the star-studded film that cost $30 million just to make. One would think a cast this packed would easily bring people out to the theaters (Paul Dano, Pete Davidson, America Ferrera, Nick Offerman, Anthony Ramos, Sebastian Stan, Shailene Woodley and Seth Rogen), but the SAG-AFTRA strike prevented the actors from making the press rounds and certainly played a factor into the film’s underperformance. \n",
      "\tFrom Variety’s review: “A commercial movie needs a hero, and ‘Dumb Money,’ which is defter, more fun, and less labored than ‘The Big Short’ (it doesn’t keep chewing on its exposition), has a shaggy hero, of sorts, in Keith, played by Paul Dano as a kind of quirky, saintly, dough-faced financial savant. He wins you over to his cracked conviction.”\n",

      "Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman named “The Covenant” one of the best films of the year midway through 2023, but strong reviews from critics weren’t enough to save the war movie from being a flop. The film earned just $21 million at the worldwide box office, a disappointing sum for a war movie and a near-disaster for a film that carried a production budget north of $50 million. Gleiberman wrote: “Jake Gyllenhaal, in his finest performance in years, plays a U.S. platoon leader who is wounded in an ambush, and Dar Salim is the wily, tough-as-nails Afghan translator who rescues him, in a journey of harrowing suspense, only to have Gyllenhaal return the favor by plunging back into the war.

The movie performed stronger overseas with a worldwide total of $24 million, but it was hardly enough to match a production budget that reportedly exceeded $30 million. Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman named “Tár” the best movie of 2022, writing, “It’s a staggering portrait of celebrity and power. It’s a seductive peek into the lofty bubble of the classical-music world. It’s an insidiously unfolding thriller about a brilliant artist, addicted to beauty, who’s undone by her own appetites.”\n",

The Universal-backed drama cost a reported $40 million to produce but only earned $17 million at the domestic box office. It managed to crack $42 million worldwide, but matching your production budget isn’t much of a success considering there was still a hefty marketing spend and a prolonged awards season press tour that cost additional millions for Universal. \n",

The raucous look at silent film actors (played by the likes of Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie) struggling to adapt to sound pictures in Hollywood’s transformative 1920s and 1930s was over-the-top and overblown, but all the buzz about its debauchery did not translate to box office dollars. The film barely cracked $15 million at the domestic box office and tapped out with $63 million worldwide, a huge financial loss considering Paramount reportedly spent at least $80 million on the production and then millions more on marketing. “Babylon” may have its detractors, but its rollercoaster energy can’t be denied.\n",

The movie accomplishes this by tapping into something that was always an essential part the Weinstein saga, but one I’ve never experienced as vividly as I did watching ‘She Said’: the pervasive, unfathomable fear that ruled Harvey Weinstein’s victims.”\n",

The Amazon Studios release tanked at the box office with a paltry $2 million opening. It’s a shame given how idiosyncratic Miller’s vision is for the film. As the scholar and the djinn debate the ethics of wish-making, Miller flashes back through history to depict elaborate memories of the djinn’s three thousand years wandering the globe. Variety awards editor Clayton Davis wrote out of Cannes, “You’ll hear the awards comparisons that call it Miller’s version of ‘The Shape of Water’ (2017), Guillermo del Toro’s Oscar-winner for best picture, but it’s closer to Terrence Malick’s ‘The Tree of Life’ (2012) but with an accessible and soulful core.”\n",

Regardless, “Bros” is a consistently funny movie that sticks to a tried and true romantic-comedy formula. In other words, there’s no reason it shouldn’t be a big crowd-pleaser that attracts many eyeballs.

Scorsese said it was “distressing” how moviegoers were not turning out to see “Nightmare Alley,” which stars Bradley Cooper as a con man who rises the ranks from carnival worker to world-famous illusionist. Variety’s Peter Debruge named “Nightmare Alley” a critics pick and called it “a bravura noir” in his rave review, adding, “The ‘Shape of Water’ director assembles a dream ensemble for this spectacular sideshow attraction, including Cate Blanchett as the iciest femme fatale we’ve seen in ages.” Despite tanking at the box office, “Nightmare Alley” dazzled Academy voters enough to earn four Oscar nominations, including best picture.

Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” adaptation dazzled film critics, but U.S. moviegoers largely ignored the film as it grossed just $38 million at the domestic box office. The film’s global haul perked up to $73 million, but that wasn’t good enough considering the musical cost well over $100 million to produce. One can only hope the film’s debut on streaming via Disney Plus in March 2022 is bringing in fresh eyeballs. “West Side Story” earned seven Oscar nominations, including bids for picture, director and supporting actress for frontrunner Ariana DeBose.

Chu stages it all with a bravura playfulness, whether he’s setting a production number about upscale dreams in a public swimming pool or letting two lovers loose on the side of a building. ‘In the Heights’ shows us the neighborhood from literally every angle, capturing the lives of people caught up in a delirious, at times heartbreaking dance between the land of their ancestors and the America they’ve made their own.” The film is now available to stream on HBO Max.\n",

Those numbers make it a historic flop, especially for major stars such as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. The abysmal box office was unfortunate considering Scott cooked up a “rather interesting” historical epic and “an engrossing drama of ambition, romance, and political chicanery,” as Variety’s Owen Gleiberman wrote in his review. Scott lashed out at millennials for killing the movie at the box office, telling Marc Maron, “I think what it boils down to — what we’ve got today [are] the audiences who were brought up on these fucking cellphones.

It’s safe to assume that the generations of viewers who were used to watching “The Sopranos” on television or streaming stuck with that viewing method for “The Many Saints of Newark.” Variety’s Owen Gleiberman called the prequel “a lively and convincing origin story” that’s “compulsively authentic and watchable the way that the show was.” The film is now available to stream on HBO Max.\n",

Those final tallies are painfully low for a comic book tentpole, especially one carrying a $185 million production budget. Variety praised Gunn’s vision as “cunningly scuzzy” in the way that David Ayer’s “Suicide Squad” should’ve been. The review adds: “It’s a team-of-scruffy-cutthroats origin story that feels honestly dunked in the grunge underworld, and shot for shot it’s made with a slicing ingenuity that honors the genre of ‘The Dirty Dozen.’” Fortunately, it appears “The Suicide Squad” found its audience on HBO Max as sequel series “Peacemaker” was a slam-dunk hit for the streaming service this year and will return for a second season.\n",

That’s a flop when you have A-lister Brad Pitt front and center in an epic space odyssey (especially during a career peak thanks to his awards season press tour for “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”). Far from your standard action film, “Ad Astra” projects the intimate story of a man wrestling with the legacy of his father on a canvas as expansive as the solar system. As Variety wrote in its review: “James Gray, the director and co-writer of ‘Ad Astra,’ is the furthest thing you could imagine from a space dude; but in taking on his first blockbustery sci-fi project, he handles the vast logistical challenges of staging an epic space adventure with a surefire hand and a sense of detail, pace and control that are notably accomplished, if not quite Kubrickian.

Alas, the film tanked domestically with just $31 million. That might be because Flanagan delivered a more slow-burn horror trip than your standard Blumhouse creeper or jump scare-filled “It” movie. As Variety’s Owen Gleiberman wrote in his review: “I still don’t know if ‘The Shining’ needed a second act, but ‘Doctor Sleep’ presents one that’s fresh and unsettling enough to justify its existence. The film runs on for an unnecessarily extended 151 minutes, and that’s undoubtedly a by-product of the success of ‘It,’ the lengthy 2017 adaptation of the first half of King’s killer-clown novel.

The film stars Kidman as a former police officer who takes revenge against the gang that was at the center of a blown case from years prior. From Variety’s review: “Nicole Kidman goes dark — and nearly unrecognizable — in a role that all but obliterates the idea that audiences require likable protagonists…Kidman has always been a chameleon, but in this case, she doesn’t merely change her color (or don a fake nose, à la ‘The Hours’); she disappears into an entirely new skin, rearranging her insides to fit the character’s tough hide.”\n",

Regardless, the film won Oscars for cinematography and visual effects and remains a science-fiction touchstone of the 2010s.

Set in 2027, the films stars Clive Owen as civil servant who must help the first pregnant women in two decades escape the chaos of a world on the brink of collapse. The film’s critical adoration helped push it to three Oscar nominations, including adapted screenplay. From Variety’s review: “The film more than delivers on the action front — not in bang-for-your-buck spectacle but in the kind of gritty, docu-like sequences that haul viewers out of their seats and alongside the main protagonists. Along with camera operator George Richmond, who shot the entire movie handheld in 16 weeks, Cuaron orchestrates several lengthy single takes that have a frontline feel.”\n",

      "“Rarely has a film been so keyed into its time — in ways that, commercially, will be both advantageous and damaging as ‘Fight Club,’” Variety wrote in its original review of David Fincher’s 1999 classic. “On one hand, the film is the perfect reflection of the millennium malaise that pits pervasive nihilism against an urgent need for something to grasp onto; on the other, it caps off a period in which the media and Washington have never been so assiduous in pointing the finger at Hollywood over the impact of screen violence on society and on youth in particular.” It might be one of Fincher’s most popular films now, but “Fight Club” flopped back in 1999 with $37 million at the U.S. box office on a production budget north of $60 million. As Variety’s review noted, “Despite certain hostility from some sectors, especially in the U.S., this bold, inventive, sustained adrenaline rush of a movie about a guru who advocates brutality and mayhem should excite and exhilarate young audiences everywhere.”\n",
      "Grindhouse\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n",
      "Quentin Tarantino is one of the rare directors that can get adults into movie theaters, but that wasn’t the case with “Grindhouse.” Clearly audiences just weren’t interested in a three hour double feature homage to the exploitation era from Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, as “Grindhouse” flopped at the box office with just $25 million in the U.S. (each entry was released separately overseas). Critics were mostly impressed, including Variety: “The 1970s exploitation movie gropes, bites, kicks, slugs, blasts, smashes and cusses its way back to life in ‘Grindhouse,’ a ‘Rodriguez/Tarantino double feature’ that lovingly resurrects a disreputable but cultishly embraced form of era-specific film production and exhibition…As genre rehabs go, ‘Grindhouse’ is more daring and audacious than most, partly due to its conception as an entire program complete with two pictures, four tailor-made trailers and various for-real interstitial bits, but more so because of its stylistic fidelity to its source material.”\n",
      "Hugo\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n",
      "Martin Scorsese’s “Hugo” was hardly a box office misfire with $73 million in the U.S. and $185 million worldwide, but those numbers still made the film a financial disappointment considering the production budget ran as high as $170 million. Based on Brian Selznick’s 2007 book “The Invention of Hugo Cabret,” the movie stars Asa Butterfield as a young boy who gets caught up in a mystery involving his late father’s automaton and the pioneering filmmaker Georges Méliès. “Hugo” was nominated for 11 Oscars, including best picture, and was cited as a new family film classic by many critics upon release. As Variety noted: “In attempting to make his first film for all ages, Martin Scorsese has fashioned one for the ages. Simultaneously classical and modern, populist but also unapologetically personal, ‘Hugo’ flagrantly defies the mind-numbing quality of most contemporary kid pics and instead rewards patience, intellectual curiosity and a budding interest in cinema itself.”\n",
      "The Master\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n",
      "“With its bravura technique and superbly synched turns from Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman, ‘The Master’ release should generate robust returns and furious discussion long after its hugely anticipated bow,” Variety wrote in its review of Paul Thomas Anderson’s searing character study. That prediction didn’t exactly pan out. Despite launching to $242,127 in five theaters (a then-record at the indie box office), “The Master” failed to gain momentum nationwide and ended its run with only $16 million at the U.S. box office. Cast members Hoffman, Phoenix and Amy Adams all received Academy Award nominations for their galvanizing performances.\n",
      "Inherent Vice\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n",
      "Another great Paul Thomas Anderson directorial effort that floundered at the box office was his Thomas Pynchon adaptation “Inherent Vice,” which only mustered up $8 million at the U.S. box office and $14 million worldwide on a $20 million production budget. A shaggy and aimless-feeling neo-noir was always going to be a tough sell, even with one of Anderson’s starriest ensemble casts (Joaquin Phoenix, Josh  Brolin, Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, Benicio del Toro and more). From Variety’s review: “The ’60s are over, everyone is on the run, and there’s nowhere to hide in Paul Thomas Anderson’s audacious, fiercely funny Pynchonian stoner noir… Anderson’s seventh feature film is a groovy, richly funny stoner romp that has less in common with ‘The Big Lebowski’ than with the strain of fatalistic, ’70s-era California noirs (‘Chinatown,’ ‘The Long Goodbye,’ ‘Night Moves’).\n",
      "The Iron Giant\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n",
      "“The Iron Giant” stands as one of the greatest animated movies of all time, but the Brad Bird-directed buddy adventure got its start as a box office flop with just $23 million in the U.S. on a hefty $70 million production budget. From Variety’s review: “A visually appealing, well-crafted film, ‘The Iron Giant’ is an unalloyed success that works on several levels. Equally potent as political allegory and as animated family entertainment, Brad Bird’s ambitious, intelligent freshman feature, cleverly set in 1950s small-town America, effectively references everything from Cold War ideology to B-movie conventions, but it never loses sight of its central narrative hook, the friendship of a boy and a giant robot.”\n",
      "Mother!\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n",
      "Few movies over the last decade have been as love-it-or-hate-it as Darren Aronofsky’s allegorical thriller “Mother!” Despite an onslaught of WTF buzz and the star power of Jennifer Lawrence front and center, “Mother!” couldn’t even crack the $20 million mark in the U.S. on a $30 million production budget. As Variety’s Owen Gleiberman wrote in his review: “Darren Aronofsky’s head-trip horror movie, starring Jennifer Lawrence as a woman who slips down a rabbit hole of paranoia, is dazzling on the surface, but what lies beneath? Maybe nothing… If the only thing we wanted, or expected, a horror film to do was to get a rise out of you — to make your eyes widen and your jaw drop, to leave you in breathless chortling spasms of WTF disbelief — then Darren Aronofsky’s ‘Mother!’ would have to be reckoned some sort of masterpiece.”\n",
      "Under the Skin\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n",
      "Even with Scarlett Johansson front and center, it was always going to be a challenge for “Under the Skin” to make back its $13 million production budget given what an ambitious and experimental alien invasion movie it is. Nothing about “Under the Skin” is mainstream, so the film’s $2.6 million U.S. gross was not too surprising even if the movie is widely considered to be one of the great films of the 2010s. Johansson plays an alien stalking the streets of Scotland in order to lure men to her home and harvest their bodies for her home planet. Large stretches of the film feel like a documentary, with Johansson being filmed incognito on the streets as she roams around in characters. Other stretches of the film feel like unforgettable montages of avant garde horror. However you want to describe “Under the Skin,” it’s objectively unforgettable.\n",
      "Warrior\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n",
      "Gavin O’Connor’s “Warrior” is one of the more moving sports dramas of the 2010s. The film casts Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy as brothers who are pitted against one another in a mixed martial arts tournament, forcing them to confront their shared history and their family bonds. Nick Nolte was nominated for the Oscar for best supporting actor thanks to his performance as the father of Edgerton and Hardy’s characters, but the movie couldn’t match its $25 million production budget worldwide and only grossed $13 million in the U.S. From Variety’s original review: “’Warrior’ is an improbably effective and affecting mix of raw emotions and exciting smackdowns… Occasionally recalling the bruised and brooding virility of a young Marlon Brando, Hardy is arrestingly intense as Tommy, by turns implosive and explosive as he alternates between guilt and rage, savagery and self-loathing.”\n",
      "Steve Jobs\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n",
      "One would think an Oscar-baiting biographical drama about Steve Jobs from Oscar winners Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin would light up the box office for adult moviegoers, but that wasn’t the case for “Steve Jobs” in fall 2015. The movie only grossed $17 million at the domestic box office and $34 million worldwide, a flop for a movie costing in the $30 million range just to produce. Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet were Oscar nominated for their performances as Steve Jobs and Joanna Hoffman.  From Variety’s review: “An enthralling performance by Michael Fassbender fuels this brilliant, infuriating and richly unconventional take on the life of an American visionary… Straining like mad to be the ‘Citizen Kane’ of larger-than-life techno-prophet biopics, this is a film of brash, swaggering artifice and monumental ego, a terrific actors’ showcase and an incorrigibly entertaining ride.”\n",
