      "Far from being an afterthought or simply something to dip chips in, condiments are currently experiencing a renaissance, especially in the fine food world.  \n",
      "As Rick Sheepshanks, founder of Stokes Sauces, explains, “We have always believed condiments are more than a dollop, spoon or squeeze on the side of the plate. Consumers are encouraged to add depth to gravy, richness to casseroles; to include, stir and a whisk to make ordinary food extraordinary on the plate.” \n",
      "This is something Maria Whitehead, director of Hawkshead Relish, strongly believes. “Condiments are there to enhance the dining experience and not to take over the main event, so they should be paired to add layers of flavour to a dish or meal and elevate the experience.  \n",
      "“Sauces, in particular, have really come to the forefront in the last few years. They’re so easy to use, and versatile. Adding a touch of our Spiced Mango Ketchup, for example, to a curry makes a world of difference, bringing extra layers of complexity and zing.” \n",
      "One dedicated advocate of the importance of condiments is Laura Roberts, owner of Laura’s Larder in Orpington. “They make up about 90% of my fridge and shelf space at home, much to the annoyance of members of my household who are constantly trying to find space for fruit or yoghurt or cereal, but they really do make a meal sing,” she tells Speciality Food. “They are also perfect for the time poor and the snacker, guilty of it all.” The sustainability factor\n",
      "With sustainability a huge consideration for consumers, condiments are the perfect stock to uplift meals and help prevent food waste, while often being sustainable themselves.  \n",
      "As Athena Lee, marketing manager at ShelfNow, explains, “One of the most effective ways to reduce food waste is by using up the ingredients we already have. By incorporating condiments, we can revive and repurpose leftovers, creating entirely new and exciting flavours. Condiments can transform fridge leftovers into a delicious reinvention, ensuring that no food goes to waste.” \n",
      "With cost-conscious consumers looking for ways to make their money go further, condiments are certainly must-stocks for fine food retailers. \n",
      "According to Becky Vale, marketing director at Tracklements, “Condiments are by their very nature heroes of reducing food waste as their heritage lies in preserving the glut of the seasons. This is a tradition Tracklements is keen to continue and one of the reasons we make our ever-popular special editions, our Aromatic Medlar Jelly and our English Crabapple Jelly.  \n",
      "“More than that, condiments are the secret weapon of the larder, combatting waste wherever they’re found by generously transforming simple dishes into sumptuous feasts and adding a swell of intense flavour to everything they accompany. They are the vivacious and big-hearted guest at the table, as at home on the side of a plate of cold meats or cheese as they are adding depth to a stew.” \n",
      "Another brand that believes this is Hawkshead Relish. “There are so many more uses for condiments, that we wrote a book called Embellish with Relish, packed with recipes which use our condiments as ingredients. It can be as simple as coating a salmon steak with Black Garlic Ketchup and rolling in sesame seeds, before roasting in the oven for a quick, simple and very tasty midweek supper.” Going international\n",
      "While traditional British favourites continue to dominate sales according to ShelfNow, ever since the pandemic changed the way consumers could explore different cuisines, international flavours have seen a boom. \n",
      "“There has been an evident surge in the popularity of global flavours,” Athena explains. “Our data reveals that Indian and Italian-inspired condiments have captured a significant portion of the market, accounting for around 50% of all condiment sales. Additionally, the demand for East Asian flavours has experienced remarkable growth in the past two years.” \n",
      "As Becky says, “There’s a real sense of exploration with food at the moment, driven by social media and the need for adventure. We’re seeing a willingness to experiment and try different combinations, although this takes the form of people combining known flavours themselves rather than necessarily wanting to be presented with obscure flavours.  \n",
      "“In condiments particularly, it’s more about using established products in new and different ways rather than adopting unfamiliar new flavours.” \n",
      "One fine food retailer who has certainly experienced this desire to experiment is Laura’s Larder. “In store we’ve seen a real boost in international flavours with globally inspired condiments, sauces, oils, and seasonings bringing life to everyday meals,” Laura tells Speciality Food. \n",
      "“We’ve been enjoying a wave of texture and flavour offering complex blends of herbs, spice, speciality chillies, fruit, nuts, seeds and punches of umami. Think Japanese crispy chilli oil, Mexican salsa macha, West African shito sauce, Spanish romesco, Indian achaar, Filipino adobo and more.” \n",
      "One key way to encourage hesitant customers to steer away from their classic mayo or pesto sauces is to use exciting combinations on your in-store menu. As Laura explains, “We’ve been pimping our sandwiches at least once a week — taking inspiration from the Chinese rou jia mo, the Argentine choripán, and the South Asian paratha in our daily specials, really helping to showcase the products we sell. We find leaving one by the till with a ‘try me in today’s special’ sign really helps to boost sales.” \n",
      "Trend spotlight: Turning up the heat \n",
      "Tying into the ‘Swicy’ trend that marries sweet and spicy flavours, hot sauces are certainly enjoying a moment. Indeed, research from Tracklements revealed that 53% of shoppers are buying hot sauces at least every three months.  \n",
      "Laura Roberts agrees, “The spicy trend certainly isn’t going anywhere, is it? Considering all the pressures of daily life and knowing that spicy products can give you a quick release from stress with dopamine – then perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised. Everyone loves a hot sauce!” \n",
      "What makes the trend so significant is that it ties in well with the desire for international flavours. As Laura explains, “Some brands seem to have just nailed both the ‘hot’ and ‘international’ trends. We, and many others, love Bombom’s full range; the Gochujang, Kimchi Mayo and Ssamjang are wonderful to dip, dunk and marinate. And if you haven’t seen Conbini’s gorgeous-looking Japanese inspired sauces then check them out.” Three brands to watch\n",
      "Athena Lee, marketing manager at digital wholesaler ShelfNow, shares three best-selling sauces that hit the trends for fine food retailers.\n",
      "• Pico Sauces Punjabi Ketchup: Pico Sauces offers a range of hot sauces, chutneys, and ketchup that perfectly capture the authentic flavours of Modern India. British customers are captivated by these condiments, as they deliver a unique and delightful taste experience. The thoughtfully packaged products beautifully showcase the vibrant and diverse flavours of Indian cuisine, allowing customers to explore and incorporate exciting tastes into their meals. \n",
      "• 2 Fingers Chunky Tartare Sauce: The condiments from the 2 Fingers range have gained significant popularity, thanks to their artisanal approach and global flavour inspiration. Crafted in small batches in West London, these chunky sauces are created with free-range egg mayonnaise, fresh herbs, and absolutely no artificial sweeteners, colours, or flavours.\n",
      "• Longbottom & Co. Hot Sauce: This exceptional hot sauce is tomato and pepper-based, infused with ingredients like scotch bonnet chillies, red pepper, and tomatoes. The use of high-quality ingredients in this hot sauce enhance its versatility and ability to elevate a variety of dishes. The subtle umami undertones add an extra layer of depth and flavour, making it one of the most popular choices for those seeking a spicy and flavourful condiment.\n",

      " Capsaicin-forward, craft hot sauce makers walked the fine line between flavor and heat, all while paying homage to locally sourced chilis from around the world, at the Summer Fancy Food Show in New York City this week.\n",
      "As one of the most popular condiments in the US, hot sauce continues to pique consumer’s interest as an endorphin-boosting thrill (and in medicine to treat pain​). The star compound, capsaicin, binds to the tongue’s pain receptors, producing the familiar burning sensation. Why so popular? New Yorker​ columnist, Lauren Collins offers one explanation:“As a leisure activity, superhots offer some of the pleasures of mild drugs and extreme sports without requiring one to break the law or work out. They are near-death experiences in a bowl of guacamole.”​Along with its endorphin rush, the hot sauce movement is driven by consumer preferences for more diverse, global flavors, particularly Indian and Mexican cuisines. Expecting to rise from its 2021 value of $9.3 billion, the global hot sauce market​ is set to reach $15 billion by 2031, at a CAGR of 5% within the forecasted period. Brands dressed up the heat with novel herbs, spices, fruits and sweetenersThe Scoville Heat Unit (SHU) measures chili pungency related to its capsaicin content via liquid chromatography. For context, a bell pepper is at zero SHU, giving it a neutral flavor, while jalapeños range from 2,000 to 8,000 SHU.While hot sauce makers at the Summer Fancy Food Show weren’t showing any bhut jolokia (1.1 million SHU) or Trinidad Scorpion Butch T (1.4 million SHU), brands were dressing up the heat through unique twists through herbs, spices, fruits and sweeteners like honey and maple syrup, while doubling up as marinades.Texas-based Hoff & Pepper Sauce​ featured its line of sauces with red jalapeño, habanero  and chipotle chilis sourced from Tennessee. Your Everyday Hot Sauce features red jalapeño, habanero, chipotle, salt, vinegar and garlic with a medium heat level; while the herbaceous Mean Green gets its heat from green jalapeño and habanero with additions of parsley, lemongrass and garlic. Notably, Hoff & Pepper showcased its Smoken Ghost Ketchup, blurring the lines between its Smoken Ghost Hot Sauce and ketchup, with a heated blend of red jalapeños, habanero, chipotle and ghost peppers.Known for producing truffle condiments, New York City-based Trufflelist​ partnered with Tango Chile Sauce to blend the creamy, umami-rich flavor of black summer truffles with chili peppers, lime, apple cider vinegar, carrots and cilantro in its Truffle Hot Sauce.Clark + Hopkins’ line of hot sauces pay homage to global flavors around the world. Its lineup includes Kerala, Loas, Assam, Ethiopia, Quintiana Roo, Oaxaca, Calabria, Virginia, Chesapeake Bay, Texas, Georgia, Florida, Ukraine and Nagaland.Owner and chef, Brandon Clark, studies different regions of the world to identify core ingredients that reflect culinary tastes. “These sauces are more of a culinary sauce than just a topical hot sauce in that you can cook with them,​” he explained to FoodNavigator-USA. He adds that mixing in a can of coconut milk with the Kerala sauce, for example, will produce an authentic curry in under five minutes, speaking to the growing number of meal solutions for consumers who want to cook at home without spending too much time.As activism continues to shape brands’ core business strategies, Clark + Hopkins launches its Ukraine hot sauce, which features beets, caraway and dill, with $1 of every purchase donated to World Central Kitchen and its efforts towards rebuilding Ukraine.Woman-owned and Queens, NY-based, Queen Majesty Hot Sauce​ incorporates owner Erica Diehl’s familial cooking traditions into the brand’s line. Featured flavors include Scotch Bonnet & Ginger Hot Sauce which includes fresh scotch bonnet and fresh habanero peppers, along with white vinegar, sweet onions, orange bell peppers, lemon juice and ginger root.The Red Habanero and Black Coffee Hot Sauce blends fair trade coffee infused with white vinegar alongside fresh red habanero and red bell peppers, sweet onions, raw apple cider vinegar, garlic cloves and ginger root. The Jalapeno Tequila & Lime Sauce combines fresh jalapeño peppers with white tequila, sweet onions, raw apple cider vinegar, lime juice, green apple and ginger root.The brand partners with Ecologi to plant one tree for every order placed on their site; as well as a partnership with NYC-based, Hunger Free America, a non-profit organization that improves nutrition and food accessibility to at-risk communities.Latina-and-woman-owned and Brooklyn-based, Cantina Royal, branched off from its namesake restaurant to produce its line of Mexican hot sauces. Owners Diana Beshara and Chef Julio MM combine their extensive restaurant experience with herbs and chilis sourced from Mexico. Resilience features turmeric and tarragon alongside habanero peppers; while Chechare includes green chilis, garlic, celery and onion in an aged house vinegar.Featured in Hot Ones​, a show that puts celebrity spice tolerance to the test, Tamaulipeka features sweet tamarind and smoky chili flavors.       \n",

      "The Future. America’s love of spicy food is a long-running phenomenon, propping up a booming chili pepper industry, flavoring a variety of ethnic dishes, and inspiring some dangerous online challenges. To capitalize on the trend, you may just find a “spicy option” on every conceivable dish.\n",
      "Too hot to handleWe live in the United States of Spice.\n",
      "In 2020, the USDA reported that the chili pepper market hit $100 million, with Americans doubling their consumption of the fruit over the past 40 years.\n",
      "That’s been buoyed by the rising popularity of Latin food, Asian cuisine, and Nashville hot chicken — with chefs across the board sharing how much Americans like heat.\n",
      "Pop culture is in on the heat, too, with the Hot Ones interview series consistently going viral and Kim Kardashian’s SKKY Partners acquiring condiment startup Truff as its first deal.\n",
      "And of course, the good ole US of A is the hot sauce capital of the world, with South Carolina’s Puckerbutt Pepper Company scoring the Guinness World Record for growing the hottest pepper on Earth… twice.\n",
      "But there’s a dark side to the quest for ultimate heat. The viral Paqui One Chip Challenge — which dared customers to try eating the single chip made with Carolina Reaper and Naga Viper peppers — led to the death of 14-year-old Harris Wolobah in Massachusetts earlier this year. Paqui is now working with retailers to remove the chip from shelves nationwide.\n",

      "Far from being an afterthought or simply something to dip chips in, condiments are currently experiencing a renaissance, especially in the fine food world.  \n",
      "As Rick Sheepshanks, founder of Stokes Sauces, explains, “We have always believed condiments are more than a dollop, spoon or squeeze on the side of the plate. Consumers are encouraged to add depth to gravy, richness to casseroles; to include, stir and a whisk to make ordinary food extraordinary on the plate.” \n",
      "This is something Maria Whitehead, director of Hawkshead Relish, strongly believes. “Condiments are there to enhance the dining experience and not to take over the main event, so they should be paired to add layers of flavour to a dish or meal and elevate the experience.  \n",
      "“Sauces, in particular, have really come to the forefront in the last few years. They’re so easy to use, and versatile. Adding a touch of our Spiced Mango Ketchup, for example, to a curry makes a world of difference, bringing extra layers of complexity and zing.” \n",
      "One dedicated advocate of the importance of condiments is Laura Roberts, owner of Laura’s Larder in Orpington. “They make up about 90% of my fridge and shelf space at home, much to the annoyance of members of my household who are constantly trying to find space for fruit or yoghurt or cereal, but they really do make a meal sing,” she tells Speciality Food. “They are also perfect for the time poor and the snacker, guilty of it all.” The sustainability factor\n",
      "With sustainability a huge consideration for consumers, condiments are the perfect stock to uplift meals and help prevent food waste, while often being sustainable themselves.  \n",
      "As Athena Lee, marketing manager at ShelfNow, explains, “One of the most effective ways to reduce food waste is by using up the ingredients we already have. By incorporating condiments, we can revive and repurpose leftovers, creating entirely new and exciting flavours. Condiments can transform fridge leftovers into a delicious reinvention, ensuring that no food goes to waste.” \n",
      "With cost-conscious consumers looking for ways to make their money go further, condiments are certainly must-stocks for fine food retailers. \n",
      "According to Becky Vale, marketing director at Tracklements, “Condiments are by their very nature heroes of reducing food waste as their heritage lies in preserving the glut of the seasons. This is a tradition Tracklements is keen to continue and one of the reasons we make our ever-popular special editions, our Aromatic Medlar Jelly and our English Crabapple Jelly.  \n",
      "“More than that, condiments are the secret weapon of the larder, combatting waste wherever they’re found by generously transforming simple dishes into sumptuous feasts and adding a swell of intense flavour to everything they accompany. They are the vivacious and big-hearted guest at the table, as at home on the side of a plate of cold meats or cheese as they are adding depth to a stew.” \n",
      "Another brand that believes this is Hawkshead Relish. “There are so many more uses for condiments, that we wrote a book called Embellish with Relish, packed with recipes which use our condiments as ingredients. It can be as simple as coating a salmon steak with Black Garlic Ketchup and rolling in sesame seeds, before roasting in the oven for a quick, simple and very tasty midweek supper.” Going international\n",
      "While traditional British favourites continue to dominate sales according to ShelfNow, ever since the pandemic changed the way consumers could explore different cuisines, international flavours have seen a boom. \n",
      "“There has been an evident surge in the popularity of global flavours,” Athena explains. “Our data reveals that Indian and Italian-inspired condiments have captured a significant portion of the market, accounting for around 50% of all condiment sales. Additionally, the demand for East Asian flavours has experienced remarkable growth in the past two years.” \n",
      "As Becky says, “There’s a real sense of exploration with food at the moment, driven by social media and the need for adventure. We’re seeing a willingness to experiment and try different combinations, although this takes the form of people combining known flavours themselves rather than necessarily wanting to be presented with obscure flavours.  \n",
      "“In condiments particularly, it’s more about using established products in new and different ways rather than adopting unfamiliar new flavours.” \n",
      "One fine food retailer who has certainly experienced this desire to experiment is Laura’s Larder. “In store we’ve seen a real boost in international flavours with globally inspired condiments, sauces, oils, and seasonings bringing life to everyday meals,” Laura tells Speciality Food. \n",
      "“We’ve been enjoying a wave of texture and flavour offering complex blends of herbs, spice, speciality chillies, fruit, nuts, seeds and punches of umami. Think Japanese crispy chilli oil, Mexican salsa macha, West African shito sauce, Spanish romesco, Indian achaar, Filipino adobo and more.” \n",
      "One key way to encourage hesitant customers to steer away from their classic mayo or pesto sauces is to use exciting combinations on your in-store menu. As Laura explains, “We’ve been pimping our sandwiches at least once a week — taking inspiration from the Chinese rou jia mo, the Argentine choripán, and the South Asian paratha in our daily specials, really helping to showcase the products we sell. We find leaving one by the till with a ‘try me in today’s special’ sign really helps to boost sales.” \n",
      "Trend spotlight: Turning up the heat \n",
      "Tying into the ‘Swicy’ trend that marries sweet and spicy flavours, hot sauces are certainly enjoying a moment. Indeed, research from Tracklements revealed that 53% of shoppers are buying hot sauces at least every three months.  \n",
      "Laura Roberts agrees, “The spicy trend certainly isn’t going anywhere, is it? Considering all the pressures of daily life and knowing that spicy products can give you a quick release from stress with dopamine – then perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised. Everyone loves a hot sauce!” \n",
      "What makes the trend so significant is that it ties in well with the desire for international flavours. As Laura explains, “Some brands seem to have just nailed both the ‘hot’ and ‘international’ trends. We, and many others, love Bombom’s full range; the Gochujang, Kimchi Mayo and Ssamjang are wonderful to dip, dunk and marinate. And if you haven’t seen Conbini’s gorgeous-looking Japanese inspired sauces then check them out.” Three brands to watch\n",
      "Athena Lee, marketing manager at digital wholesaler ShelfNow, shares three best-selling sauces that hit the trends for fine food retailers.\n",
      "• Pico Sauces Punjabi Ketchup: Pico Sauces offers a range of hot sauces, chutneys, and ketchup that perfectly capture the authentic flavours of Modern India. British customers are captivated by these condiments, as they deliver a unique and delightful taste experience. The thoughtfully packaged products beautifully showcase the vibrant and diverse flavours of Indian cuisine, allowing customers to explore and incorporate exciting tastes into their meals. \n",
      "• 2 Fingers Chunky Tartare Sauce: The condiments from the 2 Fingers range have gained significant popularity, thanks to their artisanal approach and global flavour inspiration. Crafted in small batches in West London, these chunky sauces are created with free-range egg mayonnaise, fresh herbs, and absolutely no artificial sweeteners, colours, or flavours.\n",
      "• Longbottom & Co. Hot Sauce: This exceptional hot sauce is tomato and pepper-based, infused with ingredients like scotch bonnet chillies, red pepper, and tomatoes. The use of high-quality ingredients in this hot sauce enhance its versatility and ability to elevate a variety of dishes. The subtle umami undertones add an extra layer of depth and flavour, making it one of the most popular choices for those seeking a spicy and flavourful condiment.\n",

      "According to Statista, most U.S. YouTube users are 34 or younger and spend most of their time online.\n",
      "For the Millennial and Gen Z generations, environmental awareness is crucial. Around 67% of Gen Z audiences and 71% of Millennials believe the climate should be the top priority: Environmental trending videos often emphasize supporting sustainable lifestyles, increasing public awareness, and highlighting the richness and beauty of nature. Here are the top environmental videos that have been trending on YouTube:\n",
      "Climate Change and Sustainability: Share valuable information and news about promoting sustainable practices and the impacts of climate change.\n",
      "Eco-friendly Living: Share practical tips and tricks for a more eco-friendly lifestyle, such as composting, reducing plastic waste, and choosing sustainable products.\n",
      "Wildlife and Nature Documentaries: Present the beauty and diversity of the natural world, which often features rare or endangered species and the importance of protecting natural habitats.\n",
      "Environmental Activism: Use YouTube to promote environmental causes and raise awareness about environmental issues, often featuring stories, news, and interviews with activists and experts.\n",
      "Trend #13: New Content Creation Practices\n",
      "YouTube is in a state of constant evolution, launching new features that give creators the ability to engage with their audiences in fresher and more innovative ways.\n",
      "Over the last year, YouTube launched two features that will change how you present your videos:\n",
      "Chapters\n",
      "Chapters allow creators to segment their videos into sections, each with its unique name, so that their viewers can skip to the parts they want to see by clicking on the video progress bar (similar to book chapters, hence the name):\n",
      "To add chapters to a video, you need to manually add the name and timestamps of each section in the description. You are required to set up the first chapter with the timestamp 00:00. You also need to add at least three timestamps listed in ascending order, with each one having a 10-second minimum length:\n",
      "Note: You can also set up automatic chapters by checking the “Allow automatic chapters (when available and eligible)” on your video description page.\n",
      "Here’s a short tutorial from YouTube that explains how chapters work and how to set them up properly:\n",
      "One benefit of using chapters is that your video can end up positioned as a “Suggested Clips” on Google above most (if not all) search results. This helps creators diversify their traffic source even further.\n",
      "When a user is shown a Suggested Clip in the SERPs, they can jump to a specific point in the video where the answer to the search query appears:\n",
      "Premieres\n",
      "Premieres allow creators to publish a new pre-recorded video while simultaneously engaging with their fans through live comments, reminiscent of a live streaming experience. Here’s a basic rundown on how Premieres work:\n",
      "To make the most out of a Premiere, you want to promote your video as much as possible using some of the newer community engagement options shown above.\n",
      "By the time the video goes live, be sure to answer any questions that arise and communicate openly with your viewers. After the Premiere ends, your video will get a “Premiered” and the date when it was published. Your viewers will also be able to see the live chat as it happened during the Premiere:\n",
      "Final Thoughts: Leveraging YouTube Trends for Video Success\n",
      "Identifying and harnessing the power of YouTube trends is an effective way to boost your video marketing plan. They help you stay relevant, attract new subscribers, maximize engagement, and drive significant brand growth.\n",
      "As the popular video platform continues to grow and evolve, you must keep an eye on changing or emerging trends. This will allow you to jump on these trends early, significantly increasing their positive impact. Brands and content creators can publish video content that will be seen by an even larger number of users.\n",

Brands embrace the sweet-heat trendFrom fast food to condiments and cocktails, sweet heat is showing up everywhere.Some of the food and drink brands embracing “swiciness.” TODAY Illustration / Getty ImagesAug. 28, 2023, 2:48 PM UTCBy Emily GerardWith apologies to salted caramel and kettle corn, sweet and salty flavors are being replaced on menus by a hotter new combo. From restaurants to grocery stores, the combo of sweet and spicy is everywhere right now, and like any supercouple worth its salt — er, sugar — it has officially ascended to portmanteau status. It’s time to buckle up for the era of “swicy.”“When I first started in the industry, sweet and salty was the new thing,” says Nick Wuest, senior manager at Shake Shack’s Innovation Kitchen. “You couldn’t make chocolate chip cookies without putting salt on them. Seeing people get more excited pairing sweet and spicy now expands our toolbox and gives us more to work with. And it just happens to be one of my favorite combinations.”Outback’s new ‘swicy’ menu embraces the sweet-heat trend.\n",
      "Outback SteakhouseHot honey is only getting hotterCondiments like hot honey — particularly Mike’s — have been popular for years, but new data show that consumers today are seeking out complex sweet and spicy flavors more than ever before, in part driven by millennials and Gen Z.According to market research firm Datassential, sweet and spicy pairings on menus are up 38% in the last year, and hot honey is projected to outpace nearly all other culinary and beverage flavors by 2027. Its mainstream status was solidified when Pizza Hut put it on its menu in select markets for a limited time.Pizza Hut’s Hot Honey Pizza and Hot Honey Wings.Pizza HutApart from Pizza Hut, customers now have swicy menu options everywhere from Chick-fil-A to Arby’s, Buffalo Wild Wings and Outback Steakhouse. Dutch Bros and Burger King recently introduced “swicy” mangonada-inspired drinks, too, while Takis got in on the trend with a Dragon Sweet Chili flavor.Why the fiery frenzy?Another market research agency, Mintel, found that two-thirds of Americans are interested in sweet and spicy sauces, while the syrup makers at Monin, which offers spicy agave, spiced brown sugar, and sweet and spicy cinnamon flavors, found that 70% of consumers who like spicy food would like to try hot honey-flavored foods and beverages.“We knew there was this need for something spicy,” says Andrea Ramirez, consumer and customer market insight manager at Torani, which launched a competing Sweet Heat Syrup this month. She calls it a “magic hot sauce” that adds more interest to both boozy and nonalcoholic drinks. “Sweet heat is showing up everywhere.” Torani’s Sweet Heat Syrup, made for swicifying your cocktails.ToraniTorani, like almost every brand, is focused on “what the consumer of tomorrow wants, and where preferences are trending,” Ramirez says. “62% of consumers like or love spiciness. But you look at Gen Z and younger millennials and they like it even more. And so that’s why you see different products that are targeted towards them. Younger consumers are asking for flavors that are not just one-note. They’re checking multiple boxes on your tongue.”Sara Hoskow, senior marketing communications manager at In the Raw, agrees. The new vegan and organic Hot Agave In the Raw “checks all the boxes” as heat is becoming more mainstream, Hoskow says. “Post-pandemic, people are still staying in the kitchen, being creative, and it’s very versatile. You can put it on anything from cocktails to mocktails, dressings, marinades, chicken and waffles, charcuterie, cheese boards, ‘girl dinners.’ You name it, it’s a perfect addition.”Hot Agave In the Raw.Agave In The RawIs it really a ‘trend’?Chefs are not surprised that the flavor combination is taking off, even if they consider it to be more of a core tenet of cooking than a fad.“For our culinary team, our whole life is about balance. Sweet and spicy is one of those magical balance moments — when you get it right, it’s incredible,” Wuest says. “A little bit of heat activates different parts of your tongue and your palate. So when we see trends like this, they are very encouraging to us, because it tells us the public is actively learning about food and why they enjoy things.”Shake Shack incorporated that balance in a recent cheeseburger menu item involving a bourbon bacon jam made with jalapeños, and a Chocolate Churro Shake developed with its team in Mexico City to find the right blend of cayenne, guajillo and chipotle peppers.Shake Shack’s Bourbon Bacon Cheddar Chicken and Bourbon Bacon Cheddar Burger.Shake Shack“It can be challenging to keep up with trends. So we try to look a little deeper about why something like ‘swicy’ is so hot,” Wuest says. He’s noticed the growing popularity of mangos with Tajín, a Mexican chili-lime salt, being sold around New York City and inspiring new fans on TikTok. It’s a combination that has been around since well before social media, but that he believes is reaching different audiences through viral videos. “People are being exposed to more, in new exciting ways, and that has made them a lot more adventurous in the way they eat.” This has also proved true for Momofuku Goods, a line of pantry staples from David Chang. Its new Hot Honey Chili Crunch and Sweet & Spicy Noodles fit right in to the current climate.Momofuku Goods’ Hot Honey Chili Crunch.Momofuku“When you look at what’s universal across multiple types of cuisine, you see this idea of sweet heat pretty consistently,” says Chang's partner Marguerite Mariscal, CEO of Momofuku and Momofuku Goods. “That’s when you start seeing a trend, even before it’s considered a trend, because it’s just something that is appealing to people.”A new hunger for classic ingredientsMomofuku restaurants have used gochujang, a subtly sweet Korean chili paste, for decades. But in the beginning, they weren’t sure customers would recognize the ingredient. In a dish they developed back in 2004, Mariscal says, “We called it ‘red dragon sauce’ or something, because I don’t think there was that mainstream familiarity with the flavor and that could turn someone away. It’s amazing to see that profile becoming more recognizable. So on the new noodles, you’ll see it right on the front of the package: ‘Korean chili paste creates a balance of sweet and heat.’ It’s really calling that out in a way I don’t know if we would have 10 years ago.”Mariscal believes that familiarity with different cultural influences is increasing with each generation. But instead of pointing to hashtags, she credits restaurants.“When I was growing up, we had one concept of Chinese food. Now I think there’s a lot more awareness of the range from Szechuan to Cantonese cooking, for example. And that is translating over to the grocery store,” Mariscal says. “As people experience these flavors in restaurants, they become more interested in playing with them at home. And I think the pandemic brought out an adventurous nature in home cooking, which led to an adventurous spirit while in the grocery store.”TODAYGet The RecipeHot Honey Grilled Chicken Thighs with Sweet Chili SauceMatt AbdooRamirez echoes this sentiment: “What you find from a lot of international cuisines, especially, is there’s a real complexity. I think with the population of our country getting more diverse, more flavors out there now balance multiple dimensions. There is a lot of interest from consumers and especially with Gen Z and millennials for these more interesting flavors that might be elevated twists on perennial favorites.”Swicy sipping, shaken or stirredAnyone who likes to cook or mix up a drink knows that layering flavors is key to delicious results. Fernando Sousa was a bartender for decades before becoming the national beverage director for Diageo North America.“The word ‘sweet,’ within cocktails, usually has a negative connotation,” he says, so menus tend not to label drinks as such. But like all great bartenders, he knows his fair share of people’s secrets — like this one: “Almost every cocktail has some sort of sweetener to it — we just don’t really call it out. Because as much as people say they don’t like sweet cocktails, they do. They really do.”Sousa says sweet heat “reels people back in” by giving them permission to indulge in the “guilty pleasure” of a sweet (but well-balanced) drink. He points to jalapeño tequilas like the cucumber-infused one from 21 Seeds as a popular choice for spicy margaritas, and 21 Seeds co-founder Nicole Hantas-Emanuel confirmed it is their No. 1 seller: “Spicy cocktails are all the rage.”Courtesy CointreauGet The RecipeDan Levy's Cucumber-Jalapeño MargaritaDan Levy with CointreauLike a trusty salt rim, sugar can act as a magnifying glass on flavor, according to Sousa. “From a food science standpoint, it just makes sense.”With much of the country still in the grip of summer heat, Ramirez says that customers so far are using their sweet heat syrup in fruity drinks like lemonade. But these brands are betting that “swicy” has staying power.“When trends start hitting in different seasons instead of fizzling out, that’s when you’re like, OK, spicy cocktails are here to stay, all year round,” says Sousa. “I’m curious how the swicy trend leads into the fall. I think there’s a way for it to fit every season. I foresee so many pumpkin spice martinis with a kick.”Emily GerardEmily Gerard is a writer at the TODAY show, by way of ABC’s Nightline and Vanity Fair magazine.

But are brands equipped to keep up with the Gen Z dominant platform TikTok? Some are finding ways to reach new audiences with this channel, and they're using creativity and influencers to launch some of the most engaging campaigns in the form of challenges.On TikTok, challenges are the name of the game. Although it can be applied to any social media channel, challenges on  TikTok happen when a user creates a hashtag accompanying a video and encourages others to do the same thing with their own creative take on it in their own video, using the same hashtag.  Brands are creating their own challenges and on TikTok, that has been a big success so far. Check out these eight viral challenges started by brands on TikTok.1. Chipotle: #LidFlipChipotle is one of the most popular food chains amongst millennials and Gen Z, making the brand a natural fit for TikTok. The Chipotle #LidFlip challenge involves participants recording themselves attempting to flip the lid onto the bowl without using their hands. The idea behind the challenge was to promote their new Cinco de Mayo deal with free delivery. Fans found a fun new way to engage with the brand, and the brand was able to boost awareness and sales around a prominent event.2. GUESS: #InMyDenimGUESS was one of the first major companies to partner with TikTok to host their #InMyDenim campaign in the U.S. They enlisted the help of many well-known influencers to promote their new denim jeans. The benefit of this strategy was that TikTok users who follow those content creators immediately hopped on to learn more about the challenge after seeing their favorite influencers take part in it. Moreover, followers were encouraged to record and share their own denim transformations. This gets people talking about the brand, thereby boosting the brand's engagement and customer base. With the help of this challenge, GUESS hit over 40 million views, and the videos continue to receive a lot of engagement. Not only does this gave the fashion brand a competitive edge but also access to a larger customer pool. The increased exposure across the platform results in greater revenue generation through a new shopping experience.3. Crocs: #ThousandDollarCrocsThe famous footwear company, Crocs, created a challenge of its own called the #ThousandDollarCrocs challenge. The campaign originated from a Post Malone song lyric, and soon enough, it resulted in a partnership between the musician and the brand. This not only brought the brand a flood of engagement and hype; the product sold out remarkably fast. The challenge encouraged users to share what they think their $1000 crocs would look like featuring the hashtag, and it resulted in an 18% percent increase in their follower count. Ultimately, the brand succeeds in building a loyal online following while also generating new leads and potential sales.4. Calvin Klein: #MyCalvinsThis fashion brand also hopped on the TikTok train and recruited some famous personalities to help show off their outfits using the #MyCalvins hashtag. Shawn Mendes is one of the advocates for the brand and helped them capitalize on the trend by sporting a Calvin Klein outfit in a short video. Furthermore, the campaign enlisted various other celebrities such as Kendall Jenner and A$AP Rocky, to feature their clothing items and cater to the company's audience on the platform. It helped Calvin Klein attract a diverse target audience and helped boost the online reputation and sales of the brand tremendously.5. MAC: #YouOwnItThe #YouOwnIt campaign by MAC cosmetics has hit approximately 2.3 billion views on TikTok, and everyone's taken aback by how successful the campaign has been. The aim of the campaign was to boost the exposure of MAC among today's teenagers, and the best way to acquire those clicks was by leveraging the infamous TikTok app. Several fashion and lifestyle influencers promoted the hashtag, so it gained traction and, eventually, escalated to viral status. The campaign brought MAC immense exposure and positive impressions from anyone who partook in the challenge.6. elf Cosmetics: #eyeslipsfaceThe high-end makeup brand elf also leveraged TikTok's platform to expand its audience reach. elf dedicated a song specifically for their TikTok campaign #eyeslipsface, which was inspired by Kash Doll's hit \"Ice Me Out.\" The song is named after the brand's very own acronym \"Eyes Lips Face\" and is known to be an original song commissioned for the campaign. Furthermore, with the help of some popular influencers to kick-start the campaign, the results started rolling, and they've been extraordinary. The volume of videos pouring in has been mind-blowing, and the current count stands at over 3.8 billion. What's more, this content now lives on the elf website as a content asset that helps bolster the brand's other channels.7. Fortnite: #EmoteRoyaleContestFortnite's TikTok presence resonates well with its Gen Z fans. It is so popular that with only 4 videos posted on their account, they already have approximately 1.3 million followers. Fortnite launched the campaign #EmoteRoyaleContest which asked TikTok users and followers to create and share dances that can be transformed into official emotes on Fortnite game characters. Who doesn't want a character based on them? The hashtag has since been used more than 250 million times and is widely popular amongst gamers and millennials. Users can enter the challenge by submitting their video and using the #EmoteRoyaleContest and win the chance to have their own in-game emote.8. HP: #HPCoachellaDreamland challengeHP used the popularity of the Coachella music event by collaborating with many Tik Tok influencers, including OurFire (who has 5.3 million subscribers), to promote the brand with a younger generation. The hashtag challenge generated 176 million views in record time.To TikTok and beyondNo matter what your current marketing strategy is, keeping a pulse on TikTok will separate in touch from out-of-touch brands. Whether you're looking to build a campaign, challenge, or work with influencers, it's important to see what's working already to set yourself up for success.Nouman is an electrical engineer with a passion for writing, designing, and anything tech-related.

Some of the social media challenges were so entertaining that they got viral instantly. Let’s look at some of those social media challenges.With the sudden outbreak of the CORONA virus in our lives, a lot of things around us have changed or we can say a lot of new things were introduced to us that were not there, or even if they were there not many people followed them in their lives like wearing a mask was never compulsory but with this pandemic, it became an absolute necessity. Similarly, sanitizing everything and washing our hands for 20 seconds became the “New Normal”. We all became afraid of meeting people or going out in general. Social distancing and staying at home became important for our own survival. This pandemic has definitely taught us the value of slow living and just surviving because before this we were so busy in our fast-paced lives that we forgot the importance of survival. Many people who were busy in their lives working all day and night didn’t have much time for themselves and their dear ones. But with the outbreak of this pandemic, many things changed as people started staying at home, started spending more time with their family members, and started doing more fun activities together. These activities then got spread on social media as challenges and people started taking up those challenges with their family members and friends. It also kept them connected and kept them stay away from boredom. So, we can say that this pandemic definitely came with both boons and banes. Initially, people got really confused as to how to stay at home for such an extended time but gradually they got conversant with this new lifestyle. It also made us understand the importance of our family members, our own selves, cleanliness, hygiene, and also shifted our focus from wants to needs. During this time when we all were stuck at our houses and didn’t have to go outside social media was flooded with a lot of “social media challenges” that not just entertained us but also kept us a little busy during this pandemic. Create innovative content for social media with the Best Content Writing Course   Top 21 Social Media ChallengesSocial media Challenges #1 – Doodle ChallengeAs the name suggests this challenge is about doodling. A person has to put a sheet on a person’s back and another sheet has to be placed in front of that person. Now, one has to doodle or draw something on the sheet that is attached to the back of the first person, and then this first person has to draw the same thing on the sheet that is put on his or her front side. This first person has to draw just by feeling the hand movements and the gestures of the other individual who was drawing in the back sheet. While reading it might sound confusing but while doing it is quite an interesting challenge.Social media Challenges # 2 – Don’t Rush ChallengeThis challenge got really famous on social media as this was creative and fun at the same time.

Patience ChallengeThis was a very cute and mean challenge at the same time as the parents had to put a lot of candies in a bowl in front of their kids. The kids were told not to touch the candies until the parents are back. The parents left the candies’ bowl in front of the kids and went out to test the patience of the kids. It must have been so hard for the kids to resist touching those candies but to our surprise, most of the kids passed the test as they waited patiently for their parents to return but few could not resist and just took the candies anyway. We can’t complain as this was mean to stop the kids from eating their favorite candies. It was also adorable to watch those little ones waiting patiently for their parents to return. It just made us go Awww.8. The Savage ChallengeThe song by Megan Thee Stallion, Savage, was the inspiration behind this challenge. The song became quite a rage on social media and thus The Savage Challenge came into the picture. As a part of the challenge, people had to do a definite dance routine on the Savage song which was a combination of freestyle dance. The dance moves involved hip movements of a different kind to meet the beats of the song. It got popular when the remix version of this song was taken up by Beyonce as a challenge. Many celebrities then took this challenge up.9. The Super Bowl ChallengeWhen the two legendry singers JLo and Shakira got featured in the “SuperBowl” ceremony where their dance moves were choreographed by the Royal Family themselves.

This challenge got viral instantly and many people showcased their talents by participating in it. 12. Beauty Mode ChallengeDuring the lockdown, people were mostly chilling at home in their pajamas with no makeup on. So, the TikTokers came up with this bright idea of using the beauty mode on their TikTok app to transform their looks from a non-makeup look to a full makeup look.In this challenge, people came in front of their cameras and turned on the beauty mode with a song or a dialogue in the background and then turned off the beauty mode. That made the video very interesting. Many Bollywood celebrities took up this challenge like Neha Dhupia, Amyra Dastur, Jannat Zubair, etc.13.

This was fun to do challenge and celebrities like Sameera Reddy, Jennifer Lopez, and Camila Cabello.16. Until Tomorrow ChallengeIn this challenge, the users of Instagram had to post a silly photo of themselves on their Instagram page, with the caption ‘Until Tomorrow’.

The first person had to begin with a move that was replicated by the second person, who then added an extra move for the third person to do and thus, the chain continued. Many celebrities like Dabboo Ratnani took up this challenge with his entire family which was fun to watch. Anyone can take up this fun challenge with their dear ones and have a blast.21. Trick Shot ChallengeAs we all know a trick shot is played usually on a billiards table, a shot that seems impossible or requires significant skill. This challenge was Inspired by FISU athlete Sara Meden, who had used the FISU Instagram account during the #FitAtHome campaign in April 2020. In this challenge, the objective of the participant was to land the shot despite all the obstacles. In this challenge, people had used ping-pong balls, kettles, saucepans, and many other household items that were placed meticulously on the floor, in an attempt to score a goal.

This pandemic occurred out of nowhere and made all of us sit at home for months which could have become torture for many of us. But with these social media challenges happening we could keep ourselves busy creatively. It also brought out many hidden talents that people had. It also made us aware of hygiene, cleanliness, family values, our own importance, and a lot more. These challenges were fun and engaging that’s why people got attracted to them. Before the pandemic and the lockdown also there were many social media challenges that took place and got viral-like “The Planking Challenge” which got viral in the year 2010-2011, “The Tebowing Challenge” in the year 2011, The Harlem Shake Challenge, The Ice Bucket Challenge, The Cinnamon Challenge, The Running Man Challenge, The Mannequin Challenge, The Kiki Challenge, Women for Women challenge, etc. These challenges are nothing new and they have been happening for quite some time now. I think most of these challenges are fun and doable. These challenges have kept us entertained thoroughly and you too can get creative and start a new trend or challenge on various social media platforms. Let’s experiment and try and create new and different challenges that are fun to do.

      "Over the last year, YouTube launched two features that will change how you present your videos:\n",
      "Chapters\n",
      "Chapters allow creators to segment their videos into sections, each with its unique name, so that their viewers can skip to the parts they want to see by clicking on the video progress bar (similar to book chapters, hence the name):\n",
      "To add chapters to a video, you need to manually add the name and timestamps of each section in the description. You are required to set up the first chapter with the timestamp 00:00. You also need to add at least three timestamps listed in ascending order, with each one having a 10-second minimum length:\n",

      "Here’s a short tutorial from YouTube that explains how chapters work and how to set them up properly:\n",
      "One benefit of using chapters is that your video can end up positioned as a “Suggested Clips” on Google above most (if not all) search results. This helps creators diversify their traffic source even further.\n",
      "When a user is shown a Suggested Clip in the SERPs, they can jump to a specific point in the video where the answer to the search query appears:\n",
      "Premieres\n",
      "Premieres allow creators to publish a new pre-recorded video while simultaneously engaging with their fans through live comments, reminiscent of a live streaming experience. Here’s a basic rundown on how Premieres work:\n",
      "To make the most out of a Premiere, you want to promote your video as much as possible using some of the newer community engagement options shown above.\n",
      "By the time the video goes live, be sure to answer any questions that arise and communicate openly with your viewers. After the Premiere ends, your video will get a “Premiered” and the date when it was published. Your viewers will also be able to see the live chat as it happened during the Premiere:\n",
      "Final Thoughts: Leveraging YouTube Trends for Video Success\n",
      "Identifying and harnessing the power of YouTube trends is an effective way to boost your video marketing plan. They help you stay relevant, attract new subscribers, maximize engagement, and drive significant brand growth.\n",
      "As the popular video platform continues to grow and evolve, you must keep an eye on changing or emerging trends.

Brands and content creators can publish video content that will be seen by an even larger number of users.\n",

      "### Article 1: 8 TikTok Challenges Started by Brands and what We can Learn from Them | Emplifi\n",
      "\n",
      "TikTok isn't the first social media channel for challenges, but TikTok challenges are going viral. But are brands equipped to keep up with the Gen Z dominant platform TikTok? Some are finding ways to reach new audiences with this channel, and they're using creativity and influencers to launch some of the most engaging campaigns in the form of challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "On TikTok, challenges are the name of the game. Although it can be applied to any social media channel, challenges on TikTok happen when a user creates a hashtag accompanying a video and encourages others to do the same thing with their own creative take on it in their own video, using the same hashtag. Brands are creating their own challenges and on TikTok, that has been a big success so far. Check out these eight viral challenges started by brands on TikTok.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Chipotle: #LidFlip\n",
      "Chipotle is one of the most popular food chains amongst millennials and Gen Z, making the brand a natural fit for TikTok. The Chipotle #LidFlip challenge involves participants recording themselves attempting to flip the lid onto the bowl without using their hands. The idea behind the challenge was to promote their new Cinco de Mayo deal with free delivery. Fans found a fun new way to engage with the brand, and the brand was able to boost awareness and sales around a prominent event.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. GUESS: #InMyDenim\n",
      "GUESS was one of the first major companies to partner with TikTok to host their #InMyDenim campaign in the U.S. They enlisted the help of many well-known influencers to promote their new denim jeans. The benefit of this strategy was that TikTok users who follow those content creators immediately hopped on to learn more about the challenge after seeing their favorite influencers take part in it. Moreover, followers were encouraged to record and share their own denim transformations. This gets people talking about the brand, thereby boosting the brand's engagement and customer base. With the help of this challenge, GUESS hit over 40 million views, and the videos continue to receive a lot of engagement. Not only does this give the fashion brand a competitive edge but also access to a larger customer pool. The increased exposure across the platform results in greater revenue generation through a new shopping experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Crocs: #ThousandDollarCrocs\n",
      "The famous footwear company, Crocs, created a challenge of its own called the #ThousandDollarCrocs challenge. The campaign originated from a Post Malone song lyric, and soon enough, it resulted in a partnership between the musician and the brand. This not only brought the brand a flood of engagement and hype; the product sold out remarkably fast. The challenge encouraged users to share what they think their $1000 crocs would look like featuring the hashtag, and it resulted in an 18% increase in their follower count. Ultimately, the brand succeeds in building a loyal online following while also generating new leads and potential sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Calvin Klein: #MyCalvins\n",
      "This fashion brand also hopped on the TikTok train and recruited some famous personalities to help show off their outfits using the #MyCalvins hashtag. Shawn Mendes is one of the advocates for the brand and helped them capitalize on the trend by sporting a Calvin Klein outfit in a short video. Furthermore, the campaign enlisted various other celebrities such as Kendall Jenner and A$AP Rocky, to feature their clothing items and cater to the company's audience on the platform. It helped Calvin Klein attract a diverse target audience and helped boost the online reputation and sales of the brand tremendously.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. MAC: #YouOwnIt\n",
      "The #YouOwnIt campaign by MAC cosmetics has hit approximately 2.3 billion views on TikTok, and everyone's taken aback by how successful the campaign has been. The aim of the campaign was to boost the exposure of MAC among today's teenagers, and the best way to acquire those clicks was by leveraging the infamous TikTok app. Several fashion and lifestyle influencers promoted the hashtag, so it gained traction and, eventually, escalated to viral status. The campaign brought MAC immense exposure and positive impressions from anyone who partook in the challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 6. elf Cosmetics: #eyeslipsface\n",
      "The high-end makeup brand elf also leveraged TikTok's platform to expand its audience reach. elf dedicated a song specifically for their TikTok campaign #eyeslipsface, which was inspired by Kash Doll's hit \"Ice Me Out.\" The song is named after the brand's very own acronym \"Eyes Lips Face\" and is known to be an original song commissioned for the campaign. Furthermore, with the help of some popular influencers to kick-start the campaign, the results started rolling, and they've been extraordinary. The volume of videos pouring in has been mind-blowing, and the current count stands at over 3.8 billion. What's more, this content now lives on the elf website as a content asset that helps bolster the brand's other channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7. Fortnite: #EmoteRoyaleContest\n",
      "Fortnite's TikTok presence resonates well with its Gen Z fans. It is so popular that with only 4 videos posted on their account, they already have approximately 1.3 million followers. Fortnite launched the campaign #EmoteRoyaleContest which asked TikTok users and followers to create and share dances that can be transformed into official emotes on Fortnite game characters. Who doesn't want a character based on them? The hashtag has since been used more than 250 million times and is widely popular amongst gamers and millennials. Users can enter the challenge by submitting their video and using the #EmoteRoyaleContest and win the chance to have their own in-game emote.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 8. HP: #HPCoachellaDreamland challenge\n",
      "HP used the popularity of the Coachella music event by collaborating with many Tik Tok influencers, including OurFire (who has 5.3 million subscribers), to promote the brand with a younger generation. The hashtag challenge generated 176 million views in record time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To TikTok and beyond\n",
      "No matter what your current marketing strategy is, keeping a pulse on TikTok will separate in touch from out-of-touch brands. Whether you're looking to build a campaign, challenge, or work with influencers, it's important to see what's working already to set yourself up for success.\n",

      "\n",
      "##### Social media Challenges #1 – Doodle Challenge\n",
      "As the name suggests this challenge is about doodling. A person has to put a sheet on a person’s back and another sheet has to be placed in front of that person. Now, one has to doodle or draw something on the sheet that is attached to the back of the first person, and then this first person has to draw the same thing on the sheet that is put on his or her front side. While reading it might sound confusing but while doing it is quite an interesting challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Social media Challenges # 2 – Don’t Rush Challenge\n",
      "This challenge got really famous on social media as this was creative and fun at the same time. One had to cover the camera with a brush for few seconds after showing their non-makeup look with jammies or robes on and then once the brush was removed, they had to show a full makeup look or a glam look with glammed up outfits and then they had to pass the brush on to the other person virtually. This was quite a fun social media challenge which the crowd loved a lot. After “pass the brush challenge” many similar challenges were taken up on social media inspired by this challenge like “pass the phone challenge”, “pass the pocha challenge”, etc. Celebrities like Storm Reid, Skai Jackson, Riele Downs, Marsai Martin, Eris Baker, Shahadi Wright Joseph, Lexi Underwood, Kyla Drew Simmons, Prajakta Koli, etc. took up this challenge on social media.\n",

Brands embrace the sweet-heat trendFrom fast food to condiments and cocktails, sweet heat is showing up everywhere.Some of the food and drink brands embracing “swiciness.” TODAY Illustration / Getty ImagesAug. 28, 2023, 2:48 PM UTCBy Emily GerardWith apologies to salted caramel and kettle corn, sweet and salty flavors are being replaced on menus by a hotter new combo. From restaurants to grocery stores, the combo of sweet and spicy is everywhere right now, and like any supercouple worth its salt — er, sugar — it has officially ascended to portmanteau status. It’s time to buckle up for the era of “swicy.”“When I first started in the industry, sweet and salty was the new thing,” says Nick Wuest, senior manager at Shake Shack’s Innovation Kitchen. “You couldn’t make chocolate chip cookies without putting salt on them. Seeing people get more excited pairing sweet and spicy now expands our toolbox and gives us more to work with. And it just happens to be one of my favorite combinations.”Outback’s new ‘swicy’ menu embraces the sweet-heat trend.\n",

Its mainstream status was solidified when Pizza Hut put it on its menu in select markets for a limited time.Pizza Hut’s Hot Honey Pizza and Hot Honey Wings.Pizza HutApart from Pizza Hut, customers now have swicy menu options everywhere from Chick-fil-A to Arby’s, Buffalo Wild Wings and Outback Steakhouse. Dutch Bros and Burger King recently introduced “swicy” mangonada-inspired drinks, too, while Takis got in on the trend with a Dragon Sweet Chili flavor.Why the fiery frenzy?Another market research agency, Mintel, found that two-thirds of Americans are interested in sweet and spicy sauces, while the syrup makers at Monin, which offers spicy agave, spiced brown sugar, and sweet and spicy cinnamon flavors, found that 70% of consumers who like spicy food would like to try hot honey-flavored foods and beverages.“We knew there was this need for something spicy,” says Andrea Ramirez, consumer and customer market insight manager at Torani, which launched a competing Sweet Heat Syrup this month. She calls it a “magic hot sauce” that adds more interest to both boozy and nonalcoholic drinks. “Sweet heat is showing up everywhere.” Torani’s Sweet Heat Syrup, made for swicifying your cocktails.ToraniTorani, like almost every brand, is focused on “what the consumer of tomorrow wants, and where preferences are trending,” Ramirez says. “62% of consumers like or love spiciness. But you look at Gen Z and younger millennials and they like it even more. And so that’s why you see different products that are targeted towards them. Younger consumers are asking for flavors that are not just one-note. They’re checking multiple boxes on your tongue.”Sara Hoskow, senior marketing communications manager at In the Raw, agrees. The new vegan and organic Hot Agave In the Raw “checks all the boxes” as heat is becoming more mainstream, Hoskow says. “Post-pandemic, people are still staying in the kitchen, being creative, and it’s very versatile. You can put it on anything from cocktails to mocktails, dressings, marinades, chicken and waffles, charcuterie, cheese boards, ‘girl dinners.’ You name it, it’s a perfect addition.”Hot Agave In the Raw.Agave In The RawIs it really a ‘trend’?Chefs are not surprised that the flavor combination is taking off, even if they consider it to be more of a core tenet of cooking than a fad.“For our culinary team, our whole life is about balance. Sweet and spicy is one of those magical balance moments — when you get it right, it’s incredible,” Wuest says. “A little bit of heat activates different parts of your tongue and your palate. So when we see trends like this, they are very encouraging to us, because it tells us the public is actively learning about food and why they enjoy things.”Shake Shack incorporated that balance in a recent cheeseburger menu item involving a bourbon bacon jam made with jalapeños, and a Chocolate Churro Shake developed with its team in Mexico City to find the right blend of cayenne, guajillo and chipotle peppers.Shake Shack’s Bourbon Bacon Cheddar Chicken and Bourbon Bacon Cheddar Burger.Shake Shack“It can be challenging to keep up with trends. So we try to look a little deeper about why something like ‘swicy’ is so hot,” Wuest says. He’s noticed the growing popularity of mangos with Tajín, a Mexican chili-lime salt, being sold around New York City and inspiring new fans on TikTok. It’s a combination that has been around since well before social media, but that he believes is reaching different audiences through viral videos. “People are being exposed to more, in new exciting ways, and that has made them a lot more adventurous in the way they eat.” This has also proved true for Momofuku Goods, a line of pantry staples from David Chang. Its new Hot Honey Chili Crunch and Sweet & Spicy Noodles fit right in to the current climate.Momofuku Goods’ Hot Honey Chili Crunch.Momofuku“When you look at what’s universal across multiple types of cuisine, you see this idea of sweet heat pretty consistently,” says Chang's partner Marguerite Mariscal, CEO of Momofuku and Momofuku Goods. “That’s when you start seeing a trend, even before it’s considered a trend, because it’s just something that is appealing to people.”A new hunger for classic ingredientsMomofuku restaurants have used gochujang, a subtly sweet Korean chili paste, for decades. But in the beginning, they weren’t sure customers would recognize the ingredient. In a dish they developed back in 2004, Mariscal says, “We called it ‘red dragon sauce’ or something, because I don’t think there was that mainstream familiarity with the flavor and that could turn someone away. It’s amazing to see that profile becoming more recognizable. So on the new noodles, you’ll see it right on the front of the package: ‘Korean chili paste creates a balance of sweet and heat.’ It’s really calling that out in a way I don’t know if we would have 10 years ago.”Mariscal believes that familiarity with different cultural influences is increasing with each generation. But instead of pointing to hashtags, she credits restaurants.“When I was growing up, we had one concept of Chinese food. Now I think there’s a lot more awareness of the range from Szechuan to Cantonese cooking, for example. And that is translating over to the grocery store,” Mariscal says. “As people experience these flavors in restaurants, they become more interested in playing with them at home. And I think the pandemic brought out an adventurous nature in home cooking, which led to an adventurous spirit while in the grocery store.”TODAYGet The RecipeHot Honey Grilled Chicken Thighs with Sweet Chili SauceMatt AbdooRamirez echoes this sentiment: “What you find from a lot of international cuisines, especially, is there’s a real complexity. I think with the population of our country getting more diverse, more flavors out there now balance multiple dimensions. There is a lot of interest from consumers and especially with Gen Z and millennials for these more interesting flavors that might be elevated twists on perennial favorites.”Swicy sipping, shaken or stirredAnyone who likes to cook or mix up a drink knows that layering flavors is key to delicious results. Fernando Sousa was a bartender for decades before becoming the national beverage director for Diageo North America.“The word ‘sweet,’ within cocktails, usually has a negative connotation,” he says, so menus tend not to label drinks as such. But like all great bartenders, he knows his fair share of people’s secrets — like this one: “Almost every cocktail has some sort of sweetener to it — we just don’t really call it out. Because as much as people say they don’t like sweet cocktails, they do. They really do.”Sousa says sweet heat “reels people back in” by giving them permission to indulge in the “guilty pleasure” of a sweet (but well-balanced) drink. He points to jalapeño tequilas like the cucumber-infused one from 21 Seeds as a popular choice for spicy margaritas, and 21 Seeds co-founder Nicole Hantas-Emanuel confirmed it is their No. 1 seller: “Spicy cocktails are all the rage.”Courtesy CointreauGet The RecipeDan Levy's Cucumber-Jalapeño MargaritaDan Levy with CointreauLike a trusty salt rim, sugar can act as a magnifying glass on flavor, according to Sousa. “From a food science standpoint, it just makes sense.”With much of the country still in the grip of summer heat, Ramirez says that customers so far are using their sweet heat syrup in fruity drinks like lemonade. But these brands are betting that “swicy” has staying power.“When trends start hitting in different seasons instead of fizzling out, that’s when you’re like, OK, spicy cocktails are here to stay, all year round,” says Sousa. “I’m curious how the swicy trend leads into the fall. I think there’s a way for it to fit every season. I foresee so many pumpkin spice martinis with a kick.”Emily GerardEmily Gerard is a writer at the TODAY show, by way of ABC’s Nightline and Vanity Fair magazine.

      "8 min read\n",
      "So, you’re an aspiring chef looking for the latest trends in the industry. Good thinking–keeping up with trends in food can help give you a professional edge and liven up your culinary career.\n",
      "If you are working toward a career in the kitchen, or perhaps even planning on opening your own restaurant, you should know what’s currently shaping the industry. From mushrooms to cashews, seaweed to honey, these are the culinary trends shaping the food industry in 2023–in no particular order.\n",
      "One quick note: you may notice that all of the food trends listed here are plant-based. This is because, as people move toward a more sustainable lifestyle, plant-based cooking is rising in popularity. Plant-based cuisine may also boast health benefits due to its nutrient density.\n",
      "1. Mighty Mushrooms\n",
      "Mushrooms of many kinds can be used in dishes to promote earthy flavors.\n",
      "Last year, The New York Times named mushrooms the “Ingredient of the Year” and this year they are still placing high as a culinary trend. Because of their broad range of amino acids–similar to animal proteins–versatility, and unique earthy flavor, mushrooms have been a staple in many cuisines for centuries and are a hearty way to enhance any dish. Some fun dishes to try with mushrooms are quesadillas, strata, and lasagna.\n",
      "Download a recipe for Handmade Spinach Pasta With Leeks and Wild Mushrooms from Escoffier’s Director of Culinary Industry Development Chef Frank Vollkommer!\n",
      "2. Seaweed Umami\n",
      "Umami is the flavor typically associated with meat, but it doesn’t need to come from meat. A trending way to spark the umami flavor in your dishes is seaweed. Endorsed by famous chefs such as James Martin, Gregg Wallace, Nigel Slater, and Jamie Oliver, seaweed is a superfood rich in various proteins, minerals, and trace elements.\n",
      "Thus, it can be used to enrich your meals with a host of health benefits. It’s also a sustainable alternative to many foods because it grows naturally in oceans and is eco-friendly to farm. Jump on this trend by using seaweed in a risotto, a soup, or a fresh seaweed salad.\n",
      "Dried seaweed is nutritious and provides a satisfying crunch.\n",
      "3. Urban Produce\n",
      "More and more restaurants are adding local and urban produce to their menu items this year to attract a larger crowd. Fresh, local ingredients typically have a better flavor and are more sustainable because they reduce greenhouse gasses, create resilient food systems, and preserve biodiversity.\n",
      "Urban produce, in particular, is rising in popularity. Urban produce is particularly sustainable because it is grown within city infrastructures where food wouldn’t otherwise be grown, and can use up to 98% less water. It can also utilize gray water, which produces a healthier crop.\n",
      "Urban agriculture is increasingly popular.\n",
      "4. Creamy Cashews\n",
      "Cashews are often used in plant-based cooking.\n",
      "This year, we are seeing a renewed interest in nuts. These versatile ingredients are especially popular in sauces like peanut sauce, pesto sauce, and, more recently, creamy sauce made with trending cashews. A popular ingredient in plant-based cooking, cashews are nutritious with a delicious creamy texture.\n",
      "Multiple studies have shown cashews to lower cholesterol, boost immunity, and fortify muscles and nerves. According to Technavio, the cashew market is expected to grow 5.3% in the next few years. Get on board with the trend with dishes like cashew macaroni and cashew dip for chips, crackers, and veggies.\n",
      "Download a recipe for Wild Mushroom and Leek Sauce With Cashew Cream from Escoffier’s Director of Culinary Industry Development Chef Frank Vollkommer!\n",
      "5. Instagram-Worthy Ube\n",
      "With Instagram cuisine still increasing in popularity this year as more chefs and aspiring chefs join the platform, many are experimenting with eye-catching dishes using ube. Ube is a purple yam that originated in the Philippines. It has a warm, vanilla-like flavor and works well in both sweet and savory dishes.\n",
      "There has been rising interest in the purple yam from culinary artists across the country due to its pleasant flavor, visual appeal, and supposedly numerous health benefits. Ube is not only vibrantly colored, but contains a host of antioxidants. Try your hand at ube cuisine with some ube pancakes, a batch of ube perogies, or an ube pie.\n",
      "Ube is brightly colored and makes for an aesthetically pleasing recipe–like these popsicles from Escoffier Culinary Arts Associate Degree student Michelle V.\n",
      "6. “Swicy” Honey\n",
      "“Swicy” food is a combination of sweet and spicy and it’s all the rage in the culinary world right now. One ingredient that is excellent for helping satisfy the “swicy” palate is honey. Depending on the source of its nectar, the taste of honey can vary from floral and fruity to nutty and earthy–so different types of honey can be used to complement various spicy dishes.\n",
      "Phytochemical, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties paired with a unique flavor make honey perfect to combine with a selection of spices to achieve a “swicy” and incredibly healthy dish. Recipes like hot honey sauce and “swicy” honey-roasted carrots are great opportunities to try out this new trend.\n",
      "Honey is a key ingredient for swicy foods.\n",
      "7. Climate-Conscious Lentils\n",
      "Lentils are not only tasty but can be used to decrease your carbon footprint.\n",
      "Climate-conscious eating decisions continue to trend this year in light of climate change. One extremely climate-conscious ingredient you should be using is lentils. Lentils have a negative carbon footprint because they sequester more carbon into the soil than they emit. Plus, lentils–like all legumes–are low in fat and full of vitamins. Just one half-cup serving packs 9 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber.\n",
      "The Washington Post predicts lentils will gain popularity as Americans realize how sustainable they are as well as their many health benefits, along with the variety of legumes available. Perfecting the art of cooking lentils now could put you ahead of the game when this happens. Have a go with dishes like meatless sloppy joes and sweet potato lentil chili.\n",
      "Download a recipe for Warm Lentil Salad from Escoffier’s Director of Program Development Chef Kathleen Vossenberg!\n",
      "8. Barbecue-Ready Jackfruit\n",
      "The popularity of barbecued food has been on the rise in recent years, and this year is no exception. Barbecuing provides an opportunity for chefs to showcase their creativity with new and unexpected flavors and trending jackfruit offers an ideal outlet for this. Jackfruit’s neutral flavor enables it to absorb the flavors it’s cooked in, making it a very versatile ingredient, particularly for barbecuing.\n",
      "Jackfruit contains phytonutrients said to work against cancer, hypertension, ulcers, and aging. Unripe jackfruit tends to be on the stringy side, making it a perfect plant-based alternative for meat dishes like pulled pork. Try barbecuing jackfruit into some sandwiches or tacos to get a head start on this trend.\n",
      "Jackfruit tacos from Escoffier Plant-Based Culinary Arts Student Dianna V.\n",
      "9. Plant-Based Bakers\n",
      "Plant-based baking is growing in popularity this year. We’re seeing more bakers move away from traditional methods, replacing eggs and milk with ingredients like bananas, chia seeds, and almonds. If you are still deciding on a culinary career path, you may pursue a career in plant-based baking. Escoffier’s diplomas and degrees in Baking and Pastry Arts or Plant-Based Culinary Arts can help prepare you for a career in this niche.\n",
      "“I encourage anyone who wants to invest in their culinary career to attend Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts! Their online program is top-tier, and the staff work tirelessly to support students because our success is theirs, too. I worked 60 hours a week as an employee while simultaneously running my business and keeping up with my personal life while attending this school.”*\n",
      "Shamaya Williams Coats, Escoffier Online Culinary Arts Student & Leaf Grain General Manager\n",
      "10. Opening a Plant-Based Restaurant\n",
      "If you are planning on opening a restaurant in the near future, you should know that plant-based restaurants are dining locations of choice for food connoisseurs this year. Having a plant-based restaurant may even give you a better chance at receiving a Michelin Star, since Michelin has moved to award more stars to vegan and vegetarian restaurants.\n",
      "Plant-based restaurants have been trending over the past few years.\n",
      "Are You Ready to Leverage Trends and Further Your Culinary Career?\n",
      "At Escoffier, we offer programs dedicated entirely to plant-based cooking that can help you explore culinary techniques and trends. Many of these programs are available online and can be completed from anywhere in the world with internet connectivity.\n",

      "**Key Insights and Data:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Popularity and Demographics:**\n",
      "   - According to market research firm Datassential, sweet and spicy pairings on menus have increased by 38% in the past year.\n",

      "   - Mintel's research indicates that two-thirds of Americans are interested in sweet and spicy sauces.\n",
      "   - Younger generations, particularly Gen Z and younger millennials, show a higher preference for these complex flavor profiles, with 70% of consumers who enjoy spicy food expressing a desire to try hot honey-flavored foods and beverages.\n",

      "   - The combination of mangos with Tajín, a Mexican chili-lime salt, has also gained traction, especially through social media platforms like TikTok.\n",
      "   - The pandemic has encouraged people to experiment with these flavors at home, leading to more adventurous culinary habits and the introduction of swicy products in grocery stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Expert Opinions:**\n",
      "   - Chefs and culinary experts emphasize the balance and complexity that swicy flavors bring to dishes, making them more appealing to a broader audience.\n",

Millennials and Gen Z, in particular, are loving these multi-dimensional flavors.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n**[Scene 2: Introducing the Challenge]**\\n\\n*Host stands in front of a table with various swicy items.*\\n\\n**Host:** \"So here’s how the Swicy Challenge works: We have a series of sweet and spicy foods and drinks. Each round, the heat level gets higher and the sweetness gets more intense. We\\'ll rate each item on a scale from 1 to 10 based on flavor and heat. But there\\'s a twist! If you tap out, you have to face a funny consequence chosen by our viewers.\"\\n\\n*Cut to a pre-recorded segment with a spinner wheel labeled with funny consequences (e.g., dance off, wear a silly hat, sing a song).*\\n\\n---\\n\\n**[Scene 3: The Challenge Begins]**\\n\\n*Host and guests (could be popular influencers or friends) sit around the table.*\\n\\n**Host:** \"Let\\'s kick things off with Round 1: Spicy Honey on Vanilla Ice Cream.\"\\n\\n*Cut to close-ups of reactions as they taste the combination.*\\n\\n**Guest 1:** \"Wow, the honey is really hot, but the ice cream cools it down perfectly. I give it an 8 for flavor and a 5 for heat.\"\\n\\n**Guest 2:** \"I love this! The sweetness of the ice cream and the heat from the honey—it\\'s amazing. 9 for flavor, 4 for heat.\"\\n\\n*Overlay graphics showing the scores.*\\n\\n*Repeat for each round with increasing levels of heat:*\\n\\n- Round 2: Spicy Mango Salsa\\n- Round 3: Sweet Chili Chicken Wings\\n- Round 4: Spicy Chocolate\\n- Round 5: Swicy Cocktail (e.g., Jalapeño Margarita with a sweet rim)\\n\\n---\\n\\n**[Scene 4: Final Round and Reactions]**\\n\\n*Host and guests are visibly sweating but laughing and enjoying the challenge.*\\n\\n**Host:** \"Alright, we\\'ve made it to the final round. This is the ultimate test—Spicy Ghost Pepper Jelly on a Sweet Biscuit.\"\\n\\n*Cut to close-ups of reactions as they taste the final item.*\\n\\n**Guest 1:** \"Oh my gosh, this is intense! The sweetness is there, but the heat is off the charts. I give it a 10 for heat and a 7 for flavor.\"\\n\\n**Guest 2:** \"I’m tapping out! This is too much. I have to face the consequence.\"\\n\\n*Cut to guest spinning the consequence wheel and completing the funny task.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n**[Scene 5: Wrap-Up and Call to Action]**\\n\\n*Host and guests, some with funny consequence outfits, sit together laughing.*\\n\\n**Host:** \"That was an incredible challenge! The swicy trend is definitely here to stay. We had so much fun testing our limits with these sweet and spicy combos.\"\\n\\n**Guest 1:** \"I think I found some new favorite snacks and drinks!\"\\n\\n**Guest 2:** \"And I learned my limit when it comes to spice!\"\\n\\n*Cut to a close-up of the host.*\\n\\n**Host:** \"Now, it\\'s your turn!
