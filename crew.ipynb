The past few years have been all about recovering from the pandemic. Now? Hollywood and theater chains are facing the challenge of weathering a year that has been crippled by 2023's Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild of America strikes. There have been moments worth cheering about, such as the success of \"Dune: Part Two.\" But, as always, there have been plenty of sour moments at the box office as well, with more than a few flops to go along with the hits.The early part of the year was anchored by relatively smaller hits like director David Ayer's \"The Beekeeper\" and the \"Mean Girls\" musical. Mixed in along the way were a wide variety of misfires, from hopeful big studio blockbusters to smaller, original movies just trying to find their way in an uncertain theatrical landscape. Some of these flops...See full article at Slash Film4/25/2024by Ryan ScottSlash FilmSimilar NewsApple TV+The 30+ Best Gifts for Any Dad (According to a Cool Dad)5/30/2024by Sage AndersonRollingstone.comBozoma Saint John Joins the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Cast5/30/2024by Steve DeliksonTVovermind.comHow ‘Magnolia’ influenced ‘Baby Reindeer’ cinematographer Krzysztof Trojnar [Exclusive Video Interview]5/29/2024by Joyce EngGold DerbySony“If this isn’t a sign we need another Ocean’s movie”: Brad Pitt and George Clooney are Prime for Another Sequel as Duo Reunite for ‘Wolfs’ After 16 Years5/30/2024by Maria SultanFandomWireSony Pictures Boss Tony Vinciquerra Skirts Paramount Deal Talk But Says Investment Focus Is “More IP, More Product, More Library To Sell,” Not Streaming5/30/2024by Anthony D'Alessandro and Jill GoldsmithDeadline Film + TV“Better than nothing”: Days Out from the Biggest Xbox Summer Showcase in Years and PlayStation Fans React to Paltry State of Play Offering from Sony5/30/2024by Rohit TiwariFandomWireDavid AyerHenry Cavill, Ryan Gosling Failed With Expensive Movies While 3 Stars Made Millions With Low Budget Original Movies in 20245/29/2024by Maria SultanFandomWire“They realize they are meant to die on this mission”: Marvel’s Alleged Plan For Florence Pugh Led Thunderbolts* Sounds Way Too Similar to Suicide Squad5/28/2024by Nishanth AFandomWire2024 film and high-end TV productions shooting in the UK and Ireland: latest updates5/28/2024ScreenDailyIMDb.com, Inc. takes no responsibility for the content or accuracy of the above news articles, Tweets, or blog posts.

      "By Dustin Rowles | Film | January 2, 2024 | \n",
      "JANUARY 2, 2025 — While 2023 was the best year at the box office since the pandemic, unfortunately, the Hollywood strikes of that year took their toll on 2024, which essentially matched the overall box office numbers of 2023, give or take $50 million. That’s not bad, considering there was no Taylor Swift to save the year. The 2023 lessons of Barbie and Oppenheimer had not yet taken hold, either, so the entire top ten is nothing but sequels, prequels, spin-offs, and reboots, but a few filmmakers (Barry Jenkins and Lee Isaac Chung, in particular) took some risks that paid off both in terms of creativity and box-office. \n",
      "Here are the year’s top-grossing films: \n",
      "Mufasa: Lion King — Disney has not had a great couple of years, and audiences have grown weary of live-action remakes. Nevertheless, audiences flocked over the holidays to see the prequel to a live-action remake directed by none other than Barry Jenkins, who gave the picture a huge heart to go along with big laughs provided by the voices of Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner. The studio may have some ups and downs, but at the end of the day, Disney is gonna Disney. (Domestic: $365 million; Worldwide; $1.3 billion)\n",
      "Despicable Me 4 — We almost hate to see the 6th film in a tired franchise finish so high at the year’s box office, but the kids never tire of Gru and Co., which kept kids in theaters around the world during the hot summer months of July and August. It was a fine movie; adults could tolerate it, and it was a real crowd-pleaser for those under 9. There are worse things (see, e.g. Ryan Reynolds’ imaginary friend flick, If). (Domestic: $350 million; Worldwide: $1.1 billion)\n",
      "Twisters — Sliding into the same weekend as last year’s Barbie and Oppenheimer, Lee Isaac Chung’s (Minari) Twister sequel had the scale of a giant blockbuster but the heavy themes of an eco-thriller, which hit particularly hard this year in the midst of the hottest summer on record. No one, however, was hotter than Glen Powell, who finally broke into the A-list by starring in the unexpected blockbuster hit of the year. (Domestic: $300 million; Global: $850 million)\n",
      "Inside Out 2 — Pixar smartly limited itself to one release in 2024, which just happened to be a sequel to one of the studio’s three best films. Kelsey Mann, in his feature debut, managed to capture most of the magic of the original (despite the lack of Bing Bong, or the voices of Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling). It’s hard to know what it means for the future of Pixar, but Inside Out 2 recaptured some of its lost mojo. (Domestic: $287 million; Worldwide: $789 million)\n",
      "Fall Guy — Building on the success of Barbie, Ryan Gosling joined forces with Emily Blunt and director David Leitch (John Wick) to give us a much-needed old-school action comedy that succeeded less because of the IP (no one even remembers the Fall Guy TV series) and more because of old-fashioned star power, a very funny script, and some spectacular action sequences. (Domestic: $320 million; Global: $785 million)\n",
      "Deadpool 3 — Save for Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe, superhero films largely took a break in 2024, proving to be a boon for Deadpool 3, which teamed Ryan Reynolds with Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine. Yes, it was too self-referential and a little too overstuffed with inside jokes, but the cameos were fun as hell, and the film itself was a blast. It did not leave an indelible mark or change the superhero genre for the better in any meaningful way, but it was wildly entertaining. (Domestic: $265 million; Worldwide: $732 million) \n",
      "Gladiator 2 — There was a huge question mark about whether audiences would show up for a swords-and-sandals sequel to a 24-year-old film starring an actor (Paul Mescal) little-known outside of indie films coming from a prolific 87-year-old director whose better days were perhaps behind him, but hell if Ridley Scott didn’t pull it off. It helps to have Pedro Pascal and Denzel Washington join the cast, but it was also a great film, and every dad in America answered its siren call. (Domestic: $230 million; Global: $510 million). \n",
      "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga — The Fury Road prequel did not quite match the intensity of the Charlize Theron entry, but never count out George Miller, who still provided audiences with a lot of huge thrills, some outstanding visuals, and an ending we will not soon forget. It won’t go down as one of the ten best movies of the decade, but it did manage to outgross its predecessor. (Domestic: $175 million; Global: $450 million). \n",
      "Ballerina — You’d think that audiences might tire of the John Wick franchise, but Ballerina managed to freshen up the film franchise by turning its focus on a new character played by Ana de Armas, a welcome addition, although Len Wiseman’s direction often left something to be desired. (Domestic: $187 million; Worldwide: $440 million). \n",
      "Beetlejuice 2 — While Gladiator had twenty-four years between sequels, Beetlejuice really upped that gap with 36 years in between. Tim Burton has lost his touch, and the film was something of a mediocre mess, but Jenna Ortega brought in a young audience while older folks returned to see Michael Keaton reprise his role and also to see how bloody fantastic Winona Ryder looks all these years later. (Domestic: $155 million; Worldwide: $400 million)\n",
      "Flops\n",
      "Ghostbusters: Frozen — Jason Reitman’s Ghostbusters: Afterworld was better than most expected, and it was fun to bring the old gang back for an extended cameo, but no one asked for this. There was actually too much of the original cast, and it was another one of those “What are you doing, Carrie Coon?” roles. It was a terrible movie (27 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) that not even Paul Rudd and Ernie Hudson’s combined charm could save. (Domestic: $74 million; Worldwide: $201 million)\n",
      "Madame Web — Before the superhero genre could rebound from its terrible 2023, it first had to hit bottom. Madame Web was the bottom. Kraven the Hunter was better (and Venom 3 was pushed to 2025), but Madame Web was Morbius levels of bad, and it wasn’t even funny to hate it. (Domestic: $59 million; Worldwide: $121 million)\n",
      "Horizon: An American Saga — Warner Brothers took a big risk on Kevin Costner’s costly two-part Western, and boy did it backfire. People love to see Kevin Costner in Westerns on TV, but trying to lure dads out of their houses to see not one but two films in a six-week span was too much to ask. Everyone always complains about what a bomb Waterworld was, but that film actually made money. These two films — which cost $200 million combined — decidedly did not, in part because there was no global audience for it. (Horizon: An American Saga Part I: Domestic: $39 million; $51 million worldwide; Part I1: Domestic: $22 million; Worldwide: $34 million). \n",
      "Transformers One — The live-action franchise had already run out of steam after seven Transformers films, and no one was asking for an animated prequel, even one voiced by actors Channing Tatum, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, and Jon Hamm. It didn’t help that the script was uninspired and the animation was boring. (Domestic: $47 million; Worldwide: $112 million). \n",
      "Wicked — Musicals had a small comeback at the end of 2023 with The Color Purple and in January with Mean Girls ($127 million domestic), but the audience for John Chu’s big-budget theatrical release of Wicked did not materialize. Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater’s break-up didn’t help matters, but the biggest problem with the film is that it just wasn’t that good. I can’t believe there’s still a part two to come next year. (Domestic: $54 million; Worldwide: $178 million). \n",

      " Argylle may struggle to meet its potential $200 million budget due to limited marketing and the challenge of attracting an audience unfamiliar with the original IP. Lisa Frankenstein, marketed as a horror rom-com, might have difficulty finding its target audience and needs to sell tickets to succeed. The release of Kraven the Hunter could face challenges as the Sony Spider-Man Universe has yet to take off and the film's delay may impact marketing expenses and excitement for the project. \n",

      " 2024 is shaping up to be another big year for the global box office with some great new releases, but there are also several films coming that could be in danger of flopping. Global theater sales appear to finally be returning to pre-COVID levels, resulting in major releases that studios are investing hundreds of millions in. In 2021, just one movie managed to cross the billion-dollar threshold, but 2022 and 2023 saw five more releases hit the milestone figure, with 2022's Avatar: The Way of Water even managing more than $2 billion. With moviegoers clearly willing to venture out to the cinema for the latest releases, the total box office figures are once again climbing, but despite a varied release of new movies coming in 2024, some movies may fail to hit their targets. This could be down to several films competing over the same release window, lack of marketing, or potentially lack of audience interest from viewers. Whether the film is a brand-new IP or a returning franchise, several movies could potentially miss their mark in 2024. \n",
      "8 Argylle February 2, 2024 Argylle, starring Henry Cavill as the international superspy with a distinct haircut, and Bryce Dallas Howard as the writer with the mysterious ability to write real-life events is releasing in February. However, with the film due to release early in 2024 and marketing around the project at a minimum, it may not get the returns the potential $200 million budget will require (via IMDb). The movie is an original IP, but with more moviegoers opting to see established franchises, Argylle needs to do more to attract an audience that doesn't know what to expect from the movie. \n",
      "7 Lisa Frankenstein February 9, 2024 Lisa Frankenstein is coming out just before Valentine's Day, and although the movie is being marketed as a horror rom-com, it could struggle to find the right audience. The movie would certainly fit in with an October release with other Halloween season movies, but whether stars Kathryn Newton and Cole Sprouse can draw the audience to see the self-proclaimed \"coming of rage\" story remains to be seen. As a reimagining of the classic Frankenstein story, it looks funny and fresh, but it also needs to sell tickets. \n",

      "With fewer movies than in past years, Marvel and DC's 2024 films will have to face superhero fatigue to come out on top at the box office.\n",
      "6 Madame Web February 14, 2024 February already appears to be a dense month for potentially large releases. Joining the line-up on Valentine's Day itself is Madame Web. Sony has struggled on multiple occasions to get their Sony Spider-Man Universe (SSU) to take off, and it appears they are hoping for Madame Web to finally change that. The film will finally see the introduction of actual spider-powered characters, and introduce a younger version of Uncle Ben. Madame Web could be the movie to turn things around for Sony, and with another two SSU films coming later in the year, it needs to be. \n",
      "5 Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire March 29, 2024 Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will continue the story after Ghostbusters: Afterlife, and it will also feature the original cast alongside the newcomers. Afterlife managed to earn a respectable $200 million on a budget of $75 million (via The Numbers), but to keep the franchise going, Frozen Empire needs to earn even more. Considering the fact that the movie is releasing on the same day as the family-friendly Kung Fu Panda 4, and the potentially more intriguing for older audiences Mickey 17, starring Robert Pattinson and directed by Bong Joon Ho, Frozen Empire could struggle. \n",
      "4 Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes May 24, 2024 Again, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is being released alongside two other major films that corner different parts of the market. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga and Garfield, starring Chris Pratt, will be released on the same day as Kingdom, which is now the fourth installment in the rebooted franchise. In addition, the last entry, War for the Planet of the Apes, saw a marked decrease in earnings from the previous one, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The movie will also move beyond Caesar, the central protagonist of the earlier entries which may cause another drop in viewers. \n",
      "3 Alien: Romulus August 16, 2024 The Alien franchise has been going since 1979, but most of the movies that have considerable success come from either the creator, Ridley Scott, or legendary director, James Cameron. Otherwise, the franchise appears to be going stale for audiences with the most recent film, Alien: Covenant only managing to pull in $75 million at the box office in 2017 (via Box Office Mojo). Alien: Romulus has a new cast and new director, and takes the franchise in a new direction, which may be enough for viewers to reignite the sparks of intrigue, but unless the trailer is incredibly promising, it could struggle to make a dent at the 2024 box office. \n",

      "2 Kraven The Hunter August 30, 2024 Back to the SSU, Kraven the Hunter is finally being released in August 2024 after being hinted at and rumored for many years prior, with the first solid update coming way back in 2018 (via The Wrap). The movie will star Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the titular Kraven, and will explore his mission to become the greatest hunter in the world. The movie has a lot of promise, but as with Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Morbius, the SSU has yet to take off, which could spell disaster for the project. The movie released a three-minute trailer in June 2023 before Kraven the Hunter's release date was pushed back by almost a year from October 2023 (via Collider). This delay alone could cost the film dearly in marketing expenses and trying to drum up excitement for the project again nearer the time of release. With so much money spent on marketing on top of production, the movie will have to exceed expectations and dominate the box office to be a success. \n",
      "1 Venom 3 November 8, 2024 \n",
      "Close\n",
      " Finally, in November 2024, the SSU will conclude its most prolific year to date with the third and final entry in the Venom trilogy. Although Tom Hardy's character may continue to appear in other projects, the series is coming to an end. The first film in the series was released in 2018 and managed to earn an impressive $856 million against its $116 million budget. Despite the success, the budget decreased slightly to $110 million for the sequel, Venom: let There Be Carnage, and while the movie managed to match domestic box office earnings for the original, it took about 40 percent less globally (via The Numbers). This significant trend downwards doesn't spark confidence for Venom 3. However, being the final entry for the series and following up two other Sony Spider-Man Universe films, the film may see box office success if everything aligns. \n",

      "\n",
      "#### Introduction\n",
      "2024 has been an intriguing year for the film industry. While some movies broke records and captivated audiences worldwide, others failed to meet expectations, resulting in significant financial losses. This blog post dives deep into the biggest box office flops of 2024, analyzing their budgets, earnings, and the reasons behind their poor performance. Additionally, we'll explore industry insights and expert opinions on why these movies didn't resonate with audiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Budget:** $100 million  \n",
      "**Box Office Earnings:** Domestic: $74 million, Worldwide: $201 million\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the nostalgia and the return of the original cast, *Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire* struggled to find its footing. Critics pointed out that the movie had too much reliance on the original cast, making it feel more like a reunion rather than a fresh take. Competing releases like *Kung Fu Panda 4* and *Mickey 17* also diverted potential viewers. The film's 27% rating on Rotten Tomatoes didn't help either.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Madame Web**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Budget:** $120 million  \n",
      "**Box Office Earnings:** Domestic: $59 million, Worldwide: $121 million\n",
      "\n",
      "Sony's attempt to expand its Spider-Man Universe with *Madame Web* fell flat. The film was plagued by poor reviews, drawing comparisons to the infamous *Morbius*. The movie's failure can be attributed to a lack of compelling storytelling and an oversaturated superhero market that left audiences with superhero fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Horizon: An American Saga**\n",
