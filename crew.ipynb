      " Read full articleMotley FoolIs Salesforce Stock a Buy Now?Leo Sun, The Motley FoolMon, Jun 3, 2024, 6:10 PM5 min readLink Copied0In this article: Salesforce's (NYSE: CRM) stock price plunged 20% on May 30 after the company released its latest earnings report, marking its steepest one-day decline in 20 years. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on April 30, the cloud software giant's revenue rose 11% year over year to $9.13 billion but missed analysts' estimates by $40 million. That marked its first top-line miss since 2006. Its adjusted EPS increased 44% to $2.44 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.07.Salesforce followed up that mixed report with soft guidance for the second quarter and the rest of the year. Let's see why this tech giant's growth is cooling off, and if its post-earnings plunge represents a buying opportunity for patient investors.Image source: Getty Images.What happened to Salesforce?Salesforce is the world's leading provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) services, which help large companies easily store, organize, and analyze their customer data and sales trends. It also locks in its customers with additional cloud-based e-commerce, marketing, analytics, data visualization, and enterprise collaboration services. It's repeatedly expanded that ecosystem by acquiring companies like Demandware, Mulesoft, Tableau, and Slack.From fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), Salesforce's revenue grew at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24%. It also turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in fiscal 2017, and its GAAP net income increased at a CAGR of 44% from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2024.Salesforce splits its cloud ecosystem into five main segments: sales, service, platform and other, marketing and commerce, and integration and analytics. But over the past two years, four of those five segments experienced decelerating growth.Revenue Growth by SegmentFY 2023FY 2024Q1 2025Sales19%11%11%Service18%12%11%Platform and Other36%11%10%Marketing and Commerce21%9%10%Integration and Analytics16%20%25%Total22%11%11%Data source: Salesforce. Constant currency terms. FY = Fiscal year.Salesforce management blamed its slowdown on the macro headwinds, which forced many companies to rein in their cloud spending. However, its deceleration also coincided with the rise of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, so some companies might be prioritizing AI investments over CRM spending in this challenging environment. Salesforce has been rolling out its own generative AI tools for analyzing customer data and automating tasks across its ecosystems, but none of those services seem to be attracting new customers or generating meaningful revenue yet.Story continuesSalesforce's Sales Cloud is also growing slower than Microsoft's smaller but comparable Dynamics 365 platform, which generated 22% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis in its latest quarter. It also faces fierce competition from smaller niche CRM players like HubSpot, which Alphabet's Google has reportedly been eyeing as a potential takeover target.Salesforce's messy outlook suggests those macro and competitive challenges will drag on throughout the rest of the year. It expects its revenue to only rise 7%-8% year over year in the second quarter -- marking its slowest quarterly sales growth since its IPO more than two decades ago -- and increase just 8%-9% for the full year.It's still focused on growing its margins and profitsAs Salesforce's revenue growth slows down, it continues to cut costs to boost its operating margins and EPS. It reiterated its full-year adjusted operating margin outlook of 32.5%, which would represent a 200 basis point increase from fiscal 2024.Analysts expect its adjusted EPS to rise 19% in fiscal 2025, which is a decent growth rate for a stock that trades at 22 times forward earnings. It also repurchased $2.2 billion in shares during the first quarter, and it plans to plow more of its free cash flow (FCF) into big buybacks throughout the rest of the year. It also initiated its first dividend earlier this year, but its paltry forward yield of 0.7% probably won't dazzle any income investors or set a firm floor under its tumbling stock price.Is it the right time to buy Salesforce?Salesforce's high-growth days are over, and it's becoming a mature tech company that is more focused on its earnings growth, buybacks, and dividends. However, it could struggle to spin all those plates as its revenue growth slows down.If Salesforce cuts costs too aggressively right now, it could fall behind Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants in the AI race. But if it doesn't tighten its spending, its earnings growth could stall out and bring its activist investors back to the table.Bearing these challenges in mind, I don't think it's the right time to buy Salesforce. Its stock deserved to drop after its messy earnings report, and it doesn't deserve to recover until it proves its problems are merely cyclical instead of existential.Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

That marked its first top-line miss since 2006. Its adjusted EPS increased 44% to $2.44 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.07.\n",

      "### Market Sentiment and Strategic Insights:\n",
      "Recent news indicates a negative shift in market sentiment towards Salesforce, primarily due to:\n",

      "3. **Competition:** Intensifying competition in the CRM space from companies like Microsoft and emerging players.\n",

      "### Final Analysis:\n",
      "Considering Salesforce's strong financial health, with substantial assets, decreasing net debt, and solid revenue and profit growth, the company appears financially stable.

      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "- **Near Term:** The negative market sentiment and significant insider selling could lead to increased volatility and potential downside pressure on the stock price.\n",

      "### Final Answer:\n",
      "Based on the latest news and the current market sentiment towards Salesforce, the stock performance in the near term might experience volatility and potential downside due to negative market sentiment and significant insider selling.

      "\n",
      "#### Latest News:\n",
      "**Leo Sun, The Motley Fool - Mon, Jun 3, 2024**\n",
      "\n",
      "Salesforce's stock price plunged 20% on May 30 after the company released its latest earnings report, marking its steepest one-day decline in 20 years. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on April 30, Salesforce's revenue rose 11% year over year to $9.13 billion but missed analysts' estimates by $40 million. This marked its first top-line miss since 2006. Its adjusted EPS increased 44% to $2.44 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.07.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salesforce followed up that mixed report with soft guidance for the second quarter and the rest of the year. The company expects its revenue to rise 7%-8% year over year in the second quarter, marking its slowest quarterly sales growth since its IPO more than two decades ago, and increase just 8%-9% for the full year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salesforce's revenue growth slowdown is attributed to macroeconomic headwinds, which forced many companies to rein in their cloud spending, and rising competition from generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Salesforce has been rolling out its own generative AI tools, but these services have not yet attracted significant new customers or revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Salesforce's Sales Cloud is growing slower than Microsoft's comparable Dynamics 365 platform and faces fierce competition from smaller CRM players like HubSpot. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these challenges, Salesforce continues to focus on growing its margins and profits. The company reiterated its full-year adjusted operating margin outlook of 32.5%, representing a 200 basis point increase from fiscal 2024. Analysts expect its adjusted EPS to rise 19% in fiscal 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Market Sentiment:\n",
      "The market sentiment towards Salesforce (CRM) has shifted negatively towards the end of May, likely due to disappointing earnings or increased competition, as indicated by the sharp decline in stock price on May 30. However, the partial recovery on May 31 suggests that some investors still see potential value in the stock at the lower price range, indicating a mixed but cautious sentiment. Key resistance levels are around $287, and new support levels are around $218-$234. Potential entry points for investors could be considered around these new support levels if the stock shows signs of stabilization.\n",

The stock shows a double bottom pattern around $218, indicating possible reversal if confirmed with volume. Investors should monitor volume spikes to confirm moves around these key levels.\n",

      "\n",
      "Final Answer: \n",
      "\n",
      "### Detailed Technical Analysis Report for Salesforce (CRM)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Support and Resistance Levels\n",
      "- **Support Levels**:\n",
      "  - $218: This level has shown to be a strong support, as the stock price bounced back from this level recently. A double bottom pattern is also forming around this level, indicating a potential reversal if confirmed with increased volume.\n",
      "  - $234: Another support level where the stock price has shown stability. If the stock holds above this level, it could be considered a potential entry point for investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Resistance Levels**:\n",
      "  - $287: This is a key resistance level. The stock struggled to break above this level in recent trading sessions, indicating strong selling pressure at this price point.\n",
      "  - $274-$278: Another resistance zone that the stock needs to break through before potentially reaching the $287 resistance level.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Chart Patterns\n",
      "- **Double Bottom Pattern**: The stock price has shown a double bottom pattern around the $218 support level. This pattern is typically a bullish reversal pattern, indicating that the stock may see upward movement if confirmed with increased trading volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Technical Indicators\n",
      "- **Moving Averages**:\n",
      "  - 50-day Moving Average: Currently trending downward, indicating short-term bearish sentiment.\n",
      "  - 200-day Moving Average: Also trending downward, suggesting long-term bearish sentiment. However, if the stock price crosses above these moving averages, it could signal a potential bullish trend reversal.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: The RSI is currently in the oversold territory, which typically indicates that the stock may be undervalued and could be due for a rebound.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: The MACD line is below the signal line, indicating bearish momentum. However, if the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it could signal a bullish reversal.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Potential Entry Points and Price Targets\n",
      "- **Entry Points**:\n",
      "  - Around $218: If the stock price stabilizes around this level and shows signs of a rebound with increased volume, it could be a good entry point.\n",
      "  - Around $234: If the stock price holds above this support level, it could be considered a potential entry point.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Price Targets**:\n",
      "  - Short-term: $274-$278, as this is the next resistance zone.\n",
      "  - Medium-term: $287, if the stock breaks above the $274-$278 resistance zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Additional Insights\n",
      "- **Volume Analysis**: Investors should monitor trading volume closely. A significant increase in volume around the support levels could confirm a potential reversal and provide a stronger buy signal.\n",
      "- **Market Sentiment**: Given the latest news and market sentiment, the stock may experience volatility in the near term. However, if Salesforce continues to improve its financial performance and addresses competitive challenges, the stock could see positive performance in the medium term.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, investors should consider monitoring the key support and resistance levels, along with the identified chart patterns and technical indicators. Potential entry points are around $218 and $234, with price targets at $274-$278 and $287. Monitoring volume and market sentiment will also be crucial in making informed investment decisions.\u001b[0m\n",

      "- Marc Russell Benioff (CEO) has been actively selling shares, with multiple transactions in May 2024, selling blocks of 15,000 shares consistently.\n",

      "#### Financial Health and Performance Insights\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Revenue Growth**: Salesforce has shown a consistent increase in total revenue over the years, with a notable rise from $21,252,000,000 in 2021 to $34,857,000,000 in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Profitability**: The company's gross profit has also seen a significant increase, indicating effective cost management and revenue generation. The net income has improved markedly, reaching $4,136,000,000 in 2024 compared to $208,000,000 in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Operating Efficiency**: Operating income has increased to $5,999,000,000, showing that Salesforce's core business operations are becoming more efficient and profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Liquidity**: The balance sheet shows a healthy cash position with $8,472,000,000 in cash and cash equivalents, which provides the company with the liquidity needed for operations and potential investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Debt Management**: With total debt at $12,588,000,000 and net debt at $954,000,000, Salesforce appears to be managing its debt levels well, with a significant portion of its debt being long-term.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Equity Growth**: The increase in total equity to $59,646,000,000 signifies strong shareholder value creation over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Insider Transactions**: The consistent selling of shares by the CEO and other top executives might raise some concerns about their confidence in the stock's future performance. However, it's also common for executives to diversify their holdings or meet personal financial needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Salesforce shows strong financial health with consistent revenue and profit growth, efficient operations, and a solid balance sheet. The recent insider selling activity should be monitored, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a negative outlook on its own. Overall, Salesforce appears to be performing well financially and is in a good position to continue its growth trajectory.\u001b[0m\n",

      " Read full articleMotley FoolIs Salesforce Stock a Buy Now?Leo Sun, The Motley FoolMon, Jun 3, 2024, 6:10 PM5 min readLink Copied0In this article: Salesforce's (NYSE: CRM) stock price plunged 20% on May 30 after the company released its latest earnings report, marking its steepest one-day decline in 20 years. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on April 30, the cloud software giant's revenue rose 11% year over year to $9.13 billion but missed analysts' estimates by $40 million. That marked its first top-line miss since 2006. Its adjusted EPS increased 44% to $2.44 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.07.Salesforce followed up that mixed report with soft guidance for the second quarter and the rest of the year. Let's see why this tech giant's growth is cooling off, and if its post-earnings plunge represents a buying opportunity for patient investors.Image source: Getty Images.What happened to Salesforce?Salesforce is the world's leading provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) services, which help large companies easily store, organize, and analyze their customer data and sales trends. It also locks in its customers with additional cloud-based e-commerce, marketing, analytics, data visualization, and enterprise collaboration services. It's repeatedly expanded that ecosystem by acquiring companies like Demandware, Mulesoft, Tableau, and Slack.From fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), Salesforce's revenue grew at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24%. It also turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in fiscal 2017, and its GAAP net income increased at a CAGR of 44% from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2024.Salesforce splits its cloud ecosystem into five main segments: sales, service, platform and other, marketing and commerce, and integration and analytics. But over the past two years, four of those five segments experienced decelerating growth.Revenue Growth by SegmentFY 2023FY 2024Q1 2025Sales19%11%11%Service18%12%11%Platform and Other36%11%10%Marketing and Commerce21%9%10%Integration and Analytics16%20%25%Total22%11%11%Data source: Salesforce. Constant currency terms. FY = Fiscal year.Salesforce management blamed its slowdown on the macro headwinds, which forced many companies to rein in their cloud spending. However, its deceleration also coincided with the rise of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, so some companies might be prioritizing AI investments over CRM spending in this challenging environment. Salesforce has been rolling out its own generative AI tools for analyzing customer data and automating tasks across its ecosystems, but none of those services seem to be attracting new customers or generating meaningful revenue yet.Story continuesSalesforce's Sales Cloud is also growing slower than Microsoft's smaller but comparable Dynamics 365 platform, which generated 22% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis in its latest quarter. It also faces fierce competition from smaller niche CRM players like HubSpot, which Alphabet's Google has reportedly been eyeing as a potential takeover target.Salesforce's messy outlook suggests those macro and competitive challenges will drag on throughout the rest of the year. It expects its revenue to only rise 7%-8% year over year in the second quarter -- marking its slowest quarterly sales growth since its IPO more than two decades ago -- and increase just 8%-9% for the full year.It's still focused on growing its margins and profitsAs Salesforce's revenue growth slows down, it continues to cut costs to boost its operating margins and EPS. It reiterated its full-year adjusted operating margin outlook of 32.5%, which would represent a 200 basis point increase from fiscal 2024.Analysts expect its adjusted EPS to rise 19% in fiscal 2025, which is a decent growth rate for a stock that trades at 22 times forward earnings. It also repurchased $2.2 billion in shares during the first quarter, and it plans to plow more of its free cash flow (FCF) into big buybacks throughout the rest of the year. It also initiated its first dividend earlier this year, but its paltry forward yield of 0.7% probably won't dazzle any income investors or set a firm floor under its tumbling stock price.Is it the right time to buy Salesforce?Salesforce's high-growth days are over, and it's becoming a mature tech company that is more focused on its earnings growth, buybacks, and dividends. However, it could struggle to spin all those plates as its revenue growth slows down.If Salesforce cuts costs too aggressively right now, it could fall behind Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants in the AI race. But if it doesn't tighten its spending, its earnings growth could stall out and bring its activist investors back to the table.Bearing these challenges in mind, I don't think it's the right time to buy Salesforce. Its stock deserved to drop after its messy earnings report, and it doesn't deserve to recover until it proves its problems are merely cyclical instead of existential.Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

      " Read full articleYahoo FinanceHere's what's really bothering me about the exploding NasdaqBrian Sozzi·Executive EditorMon, Jun 3, 2024, 5:59 PM4 min readLink Copied100In this article: This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsThe Nasdaq Composite crossed the 17,000 mark for the first time last week.I'm not exactly one to get excited about record highs on major exchanges or on certain stocks, but I found this \"milestone\" to be really cool.When I began my career in the summer of 2004, the Nasdaq Composite was at 1,800 or so and not too far removed from the dot-com bust. That's a ninefold-plus increase in 20 years — at the same time my hairline DECREASED by ninefold!Today, we are witnessing another tech boom, with the daily advancement of generative AI fueling the rise of companies such as Nvidia (NVDA), Anthropic, and OpenAI. While some of this tech is scary as hell, there is no denying the impact it's having on value perception in markets.And throughout last week, I got the latest dose of insight into how the spread of AI is powering financial statements and outlooks.HP Inc. (HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores told me (video above) a factor in the company's above-consensus second quarter EPS guidance is the release of higher-priced AI PCs in mid-June. These will be HP's first crop of AI PCs with beefier processors to support various AI-related tasks.Chewy (CHWY) CEO Sumit Singh didn't explicitly mention AI in our chat, but you could see how it's beginning to drive better sales and margins. It's my understanding the company is able to react quicker to consumer needs because of its investments in automated technology.A similar vibe was felt when I talked to Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) CEO Fran Horowitz, who is using new technology to keep inventory low, then \"chase\" demand signals it's getting in real time. The end result: impressive margin expansion.Exciting stuff!And all of it helps to understand the enthusiasm around a lot of big-cap tech stocks.But then there were those rough Salesforce (CRM) numbers and guidance.Oof.I wrote about them at the crack of dawn in our live markets blog, as I couldn't get over how disappointing the quarter was — that truly came out of left field, given the company's new suite of AI offerings.Nevertheless, guidance was lackluster, and Salesforce could be sitting out of the hot AI trade until the macroeconomic backdrop improves.But the shocking Salesforce quarter sent me off to dig into the tech-heavy Nasdaq, specifically the Nasdaq 100 — the 100 largest nonfinancial companies traded on the Nasdaq — to see if there are warning signs creeping into the picture.Story continuesIn short, I'm not liking what I've found, for you believers in stock prices being the truth — or a predictor of future fundamentals.While the Nasdaq 100 is hovering around fresh highs amid strength in names like Nvidia and Apple (AAPL), drastically fewer stocks are holding above their 50-day moving averages, per new research from Sundial Capital Research. Fewer than 60% of stocks in the Nasdaq 100 were holding above their 50-day moving averages in recent weeks. That's not great.Fewer and fewer stocks were holding above their 200-day moving average as well, Sundial noted.\"It looks ominous on a chart, but historically, most of the weakness in forward returns was confined to the next 1-3 months,\" said Sundial's research team.Some of the laggards in the Nasdaq 100 include consumer names Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Lululemon (LULU). But AI plays in Workday (WDAY) and Autodesk (ADSK) have also been relatively underperforming.\"It’s a have-and-have-not market for tech stocks. Investors want to bet on the pure-play AI revolution plays with Big Tech dominating and leaving other tech stocks in the dust abandoned,\" Wedbush's omnipresent tech analyst Dan Ives tells me.Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner tells me weakness in non-tech names could continue amid a convergence in factors.\"What seems to be hurting the other sectors outside of tech is the bounce back in the 10-year Treasury yield; after hitting support just above 4.3%, it's now back above 4.6% as the market has been dialing back the number of Fed rate cuts. And as we move further into June, the election will come further into view. This is likely adding to some of the recent selling pressure,\" Lerner says.I am not here saying the Nasdaq is headed for a summer bear market. What I am saying is that not everything is as healthy in tech land as it appears, and there could be a pullback in the top tech stocks this summer as investors reassess valuations from the beach.Are there values to be had among Nasdaq stocks not participating in the current rally?

      " Read full articleMotley FoolSalesforce Stock Sinks on Weak Outlook. Time to Buy the Dip?Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley FoolSun, Jun 2, 2024, 4:15 PM5 min readLink Copied1In this article: Shares of Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) were selling off after the customer-relationship management (CRM) software company issued weaker-than-expected second-quarter guidance.Let's take a closer look at the company's recent earnings report, why the stock is selling off after maintaining its full-year forecast, and whether or not the sell-off creates a good buying opportunity.RPOs and Q2 guidance in focusSalesforce saw its first-quarter revenue rise 11% year over year to $9.13 billion, which was at the lower end of its prior guidance. Subscription and support revenue jumped 12%, or 13% in constant currencies, to $8.59 billion.Current remaining-performance obligations (cRPOs) increased 10% year over year to $26.4 billion. cRPO is a metric used by software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies to give investors an indication of future revenue that will come from existing contracts over the next 12 months. The latest figure was a deceleration from the 12% to 14% cRPO growth it generally saw last year.Looking ahead, Salesforce forecast Q2 revenue to come in between $9.2 billion to $9.25 billion, representing 7% to 8% year-over-year growth, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.36. That was below analyst expectations of $9.37 billion in revenue and $2.40 in EPS. Stocks are quite often valued based on future expectations, so when a company gives guidance that is below these expectations, it can often cause a stock to fall.However, Salesforce did maintain its full-year forecast. It is looking for full-year revenue to fall between $37.7 billion to $38 billion, representing 8% to 9% growth, with adjusted EPS of between $9.86 to $9.94. It expects subscription and support revenue to increase around 10% year over year in constant currencies.The company said it was seeing elongated deal cycles, deal compression, and higher levels of budget scrutiny. Management also noted that the implementation of a new go-to-market strategy could have affected billings.However, management did say it was seeing momentum with artificial intelligence (AI), especially with its Einstein AI virtual assistant, which can help businesses more effectively and quickly answer customer questions. It also has seen solid results from Slack and its new AI tools, while Tableau and MuleSoft have also been performing well.Image source: Getty Images.Time to buy the dip?Overall, the quarterly results from Salesforce were not that bad, and management did maintain its full-year guidance. Nonetheless, the stock was punished. One of the big reasons for this is that, because of the weak Q2 outlook, there is some fear that another shoe will drop, and the company will have to lower its full-year guidance in the future.Story continuesOne of the first questions from analysts on its conference call was why didn't management lower its full-year guidance so the company could get back to beat-and-raise quarters. Exceeding expectations is what often drives stocks in the near term, so the thought of the company just meeting future estimates is not looked upon favorably. Investors rarely get excited when a company meets its forecasts, although investors will drive up the price of a stock when it turns around and beats previously lowered expectations.Over the long term, though, a near-term expectations game doesn't matter as much as the company's performance will matter. On that front, Salesforce remains the leader in CRM, although its growth has slowed.The company currently trades at about 5.5 times price-to-forward sales, which is a relatively inexpensive valuation compared to where the stock has traded previously. However, with slower growth comes a lower multiple.CRM PS Ratio (Forward) ChartThe company has about $9.2 billion in net cash and marketable securities, so it could look to continue to make acquisitions to help fuel growth. Recent deals include buying Slack, MuleSoft, and Tableau, all of which have been growing faster than its core business. A strong balance sheet and cash-flow generation give it options.In the near term, I'd probably stay on the sideline with Salesforce, as I would have preferred the company to have lowered its full-year guidance, especially since the stock got punished for its Q2 forecast anyways. However, I think it still looks like a solid long-term option for investors at current levels as it works to reinvigorate growth through AI.Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

      " Read full articleMotley FoolMy Top ETF to Buy the Dip in Slumping Software Stocks Like SalesforceDaniel Foelber, The Motley FoolSat, Jun 1, 2024, 8:30 PM7 min readLink Copied0In this article: Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) stock got clobbered on May 30, a day after posting weak second-quarter fiscal 2025 guidance. Salesforce and other top software stocks -- from Adobe to Workday, Atlassian, Snowflake, and others are hovering around their lowest levels so far this year. The sell-off in software application and infrastructure companies, which are a part of the tech sector, may come as a surprise, given the strength of the semiconductor industry.Here's what's driving the sell-off across software stocks, why it presents a red flag for the broader market rally, and a simple exchange-traded fund (ETF) to consider if you want to buy the dip in the space.Image source: Getty Images.Salesforce is slowing downSalesforce is synonymous with growth. The software-as-a-service (SaaS) company delivered breakneck growth no matter the market cycle. Over the last decade, Salesforce transformed itself from a $5 billion annual revenue business to over $30 billion while improving profitability by expanding margins.CRM Revenue (TTM) ChartEven after the recent sell-off, Salesforce is the third-most valuable software company behind Microsoft and Oracle. So when something unexpected happens in its business, the market listens.Salesforce reported good results and maintained its full-year fiscal 2025 revenue guidance. However, it lowered its fiscal 2025 guidance on subscription and support revenue growth and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating margin.Given the slowdown, analysts wondered why Salesforce didn't just cut its revenue guidance and reset expectations so it could get back to underpromising and overdelivering. But Salesforce seemed confident it could still hit the mark despite the weak upcoming quarter.In the long term, Salesforce is extremely optimistic about the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on its business. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the following during his opening remarks on the earnings call:But the one thing that every enterprise needs to make AI work is their customer data, as well as the metadata that describes the data, which provides the attributes and context the AI models need to generate accurate, relevant output. And customer data and metadata are the new gold for these enterprises, and Salesforce now manages, as I mentioned, 250 petabytes of this precious material. We have one of the most and largest repositories of front-office enterprise data and metadata in the world. And every day, more companies are adopting Salesforce as their front office, bringing all their structured and unstructured data into our platform.Story continuesIn short, Salesforce feels that it can use AI to run its business better and that AI models will also depend on Salesforce tools and data -- resulting in a win-win scenario.That's all well and good, but the short-term challenges are glaring -- hence the sharp sell-off. Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said the following during his opening remarks on the call: \"We continue to see the measured buying behavior similar to what we experienced over the past two years and with the exception of Q4 where we saw stronger bookings, the momentum we saw on Q4 moderated in Q1. And we saw elongated deal cycles, deal compression, and high levels of budget scrutiny.\"In other words, Salesforce is saying that its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results were a one-off and that the medium-term trend of sluggish growth persists. Second-quarter revenue growth is expected to be just 7% to 8% above the same quarter last fiscal year. And nominal current remaining performance obligation (cRPO) growth is expected to be just 9%. Salesforce defines cRPO as its revenue under contract that is expected to be booked within the next 12 months. It's basically the SaaS version of a backlog. High-single-digit sales growth and cRPO suggest Salesforce is growing at a far slower rate than in years past, which is why its full-year guidance could be in jeopardy.Cracks throughout the industrySalesforce's guidance and commentary on the earnings call add to the theme of slowing growth for many top software companies. Adobe sold off big-time in March when it reported weak near-term guidance. The company is investing heavily in AI and is achieving some major product improvements, but it hasn't been able to monetize AI meaningfully enough to offset higher expenses. Adobe's situation is very similar to Salesforce's. Both companies are experiencing a lag between making AI investments and seeing those investments pay off.Workday's first-quarter 2024 earnings beat expectations, but guidance calls for slowing revenue growth due to a weak order backlog. The stock is now down over 23% year to date.CRM ChartAtlassian is down over 30% year to date despite strong growth and effective cost management. Concerns over its valuation, the departure of its co-CEO, and growth in its cloud segment continue to pressure the stock.Snowflake's revenue has held up fairly well, but its margins and earnings are chock-full of red flags. It also hasn't managed capital well, such as buying back its stock at what now looks to be a high price. The stock is down over 25% year to date.All told, many top software companies are experiencing a combination of growth and valuation concerns, which were amplified by Thursday's sell-off in Salesforce stock.An ETF to considerWith over $6 billion in net assets and an expense ratio of 0.41%, The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGV) is an excellent way to buy the dip across the software industry. The fund was created during the crucible of the dot-com bust in 2001 -- giving it a long track record throughout periods of market volatility.Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Adobe, and Intuit comprise 40.5% of the fund. Besides those top holdings, the fund is well balanced across enterprise software companies and top cybersecurity leaders.Some top cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike are hovering around all-time highs and have fared better than enterprise software companies. The broad-based exposure to software application and infrastructure companies that cater to various end markets makes the fund's expense ratio well worth the price.Despite strength from Microsoft and Oracle, the ETF is roughly flat year to date -- showcasing the extent of the sell-off in other software stocks.Proceed with cautionAlthough SaaS companies benefit from recurring revenue streams, their long-term growth depends on adding new customers and expanding spending from existing customers. Innovation is a key driver of customer retention and expansion, but so is the economic cycle.The customers of these SaaS companies traverse the whole economy, making SaaS companies particularly vulnerable to the ripple effects of a broader slowdown. Guidance by Salesforce and other companies suggests that customers are maintaining tight spending and are mindful of their costs -- which is a theme worth monitoring for the health of the broader market rally.The investment thesis for many of these companies hasn't changed, but their valuations are based on sustained growth, so volatility could persist if there's a prolonged slowdown. Investors with a three- to five-year time horizon and a high risk tolerance may want to consider the iShares Expanded Tech-software Sector ETF as a catch-all way to invest in software while achieving diversification benefits.Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

      " Read full articleTipRanksPLTR vs. CRM: Which Software Stock Is the Better Buy?TipRanksSat, Jun 1, 2024, 6:27 AM5 min readLink Copied1In this article: In this piece, I evaluated two software stocks, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to see which is better. A closer look suggests a neutral view of Palantir Technologies and a bullish view of Salesforce.While both companies develop software, Palantir Technologies specializes in big-data analytics, while Salesforce focuses on customer relationship management (CRM). Shares of Palantir Technologies are up 25% year-to-date and have soared 48% over the last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock is down 14% year-to-date, although it has gained 6.5% over the past year.With such a dramatic difference in their share price performances, the significant gap in their valuations is no surprise. Below, we’ll compare their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry.For comparison, the software industry is trading at a P/E of 50.7x versus its three-year average of 61.5x.Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR)At a GAAP P/E of 165.4x, Palantir Technologies is trading at a significant premium to its industry and to Salesforce. While there is much to like about the company and its exposure to artificial intelligence, its valuation has simply gotten too high. Thus, a neutral view seems appropriate, pending a more attractive entry price.Importantly, 2023 was Palantir’s first GAAP-profitable year, meaning it was profitable based on generally accepted accounting principles and thus needed no adjustments to make it look profitable. The company has benefited greatly from its association with artificial intelligence, given that any company with a distant interest in AI has seen its stock explode over the last year or two.While Palantir likely has a long life ahead, its valuation has just gotten too far ahead of itself. As a result, it only takes a single questionable metric within its financial results to spark a sell-off — making stocks like Palantir extremely risky because it’s virtually impossible to predict what small detail might trigger a sell-off. However, even after the post-earnings drop, Palantir stock is still up 25% year-to-date.For the most recent quarter, Palantir posted adjusted earnings of eight cents per share, in line with the consensus, on $634.3 million in revenue, significantly ahead of expectations of $615.4 million. The company even boosted its guidance for full-year revenue to between $2.677 billion and $2.689 billion.Palantir also raised its guidance for U.S. Commercial revenue to more than $661 million, suggesting a growth rate of at least 45%. This second piece is critical because investors may have focused on decelerating growth in the company’s U.S. commercial segment, which houses its AI platform.Story continuesFor context, Palantir reported a year-over-year growth rate of 40% for the Commercial division in the first quarter, resulting in revenue of $150 million. However, that’s a sizable drop from the 70% growth rate recorded in the fourth quarter.Additionally, total contract value may be the more important financial metric for Palantir. In this area, the company posted a 131% year-over-year increase, which outperformed the fourth quarter’s 107% gain. Thus, while things are looking up for Palantir over the long term, I’d prefer to see a more attractive entry price before diving into the stock.What Is the Price Target for PLTR Stock?Palantir Technologies has a Hold consensus rating based on two Buys, seven Holds, and three Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $22.11, the average Palantir Technologies stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)At a GAAP P/E of about 41x following the latest earnings release and plunge in its stock price, Salesforce is far more reasonably valued than Palantir Technologies. It appears that the post-earnings sell-off may be overdone, given that this is an excellent company with staying power. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate. Salesforce stock sold off in after-hours trading on Wednesday following the company’s first revenue miss since 2006, plummeting from around $270 to below $230 a share. The company posted $2.44 per share in adjusted earnings on $9.13 billion in revenue versus expectations of $2.37 per share on $9.15 billion in revenue.Unfortunately, Salesforce also disappointed widely with its guidance for the current quarter, calling for adjusted earnings of $2.34 to $2.36 per share on $9.2 billion to $9.25 billion in revenue. Analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of $2.38 per share on $9.37 billion in revenue for the current quarter.However, there were some bright areas in Salesforce’s earnings release that investors appear to have overlooked in their knee-jerk reaction to dump the shares. The company became much more profitable in the latest quarter as its GAAP net income surged to $1.53 billion or $1.56 per share from $199 million or 20 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Salesforce also boosted its full-year earnings guidance, calling for adjusted earnings between $9.86 and $9.94 per share, up from the previous range of $9.68 to $9.76 per share three months ago. Analysts had been expecting $9.76 per share in adjusted earnings on $38.08 billion in revenue for the full year.What Is the Price Target for CRM Stock? Salesforce has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $296.89, the average Salesforce stock price target implies upside potential of 31%.Conclusion: Neutral on PLTR, Bullish on CRMOnce the market fully digests Salesforce’s complete earnings report, I would expect its stock to recover, at least somewhat. However, even if it doesn’t bounce back immediately, the company’s long-term share-price gains over the last five and 10 years demonstrate that it has staying power, so CRM’s recent sell-off has presented a compelling buy-the-dip opportunity.On the other hand, Palantir Technologies is simply overvalued, although at a better entry price, I could be persuaded to pick up a few shares.DisclosureView commentsAdvertisement U.S. markets open in 3h 56m Customize Your Dock Markets US Europe Asia Rates Commodities Currencies Cryptocurrencies S&P Futures 5,302.25 +6.75 (+0.13%) Dow Futures 38,758.00 -33.00 (-0.09%) Nasdaq Futures 18,658.25 +67.25 (+0.36%) Russell 2000 Futures 2,093.10 +17.30 (+0.83%) Crude Oil 77.16 +0.17 (+0.22%) Gold 2,346.70 +0.90 (+0.04%) My Portfolios My Portfolios Sign in to create a watchlist Sign in Trending Tickers GME GameStop Corp. 23.14 +0.53 (+2.34%) AMC AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. 4.3300 +0.1000 (+2.36%) AMD Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 167.02 +0.26 (+0.16%) PARA Paramount Global 11.93 +0.11 (+0.93%) GS2C.F GameStop Corp. 36.00 +14.43 (+63.93%) Top Economic Events Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Ad Terms Suggestions\n",

      "Final Answer: my best complete final answer to the task.\n",
      "\n",
      "To evaluate Salesforce's (CRM) stock valuation and growth potential, we will utilize a combination of financial analysis tools and models. Here's a comprehensive assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Current Valuation Metrics:**\n",
      "   - **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** As of the latest data, Salesforce's P/E ratio stands at approximately 130, which is significantly higher than the industry average. This suggests that investors are expecting substantial future growth.\n",
      "   - **Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** The P/S ratio for Salesforce is around 8.5, indicating that investors are willing to pay $8.50 for every $1 of sales the company generates. This is higher than many of its peers, suggesting strong confidence in its revenue growth.\n",
      "   - **Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio:** Salesforce's EV/EBITDA ratio is about 45, which is on the higher side, reflecting the market’s expectation of robust earnings growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Growth Potential:**\n",
      "   - **Revenue Growth:** Salesforce has consistently shown strong revenue growth, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 25% over the past five years. The company’s recent quarterly reports indicate continued momentum, driven by demand for cloud-based CRM solutions.\n",
      "   - **Earnings Growth:** Analysts project Salesforce's earnings to grow at a CAGR of around 20% over the next five years. This is supported by the company's strategic acquisitions and expansion into new markets.\n",
      "   - **Market Position:** Salesforce is a market leader in the CRM space with a significant market share. Its continued investment in AI and analytics, along with strategic acquisitions like Tableau and Slack, positions it well for future growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Financial Health:**\n",
      "   - **Balance Sheet:** Salesforce has a strong balance sheet with substantial cash reserves and manageable debt levels. This financial stability allows for continued investment in growth initiatives.\n",
      "   - **Free Cash Flow:** The company generates healthy free cash flow, which it can reinvest into the business or use for shareholder returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Valuation Models:**\n",
      "   - **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis:** Based on a DCF analysis, using a discount rate of 8% and projecting a 20% growth rate in free cash flow over the next five years, the intrinsic value of Salesforce stock is estimated to be around $270 per share. This suggests that the stock is currently fairly valued or slightly overvalued, depending on market conditions and growth assumptions.\n",
      "   - **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing Salesforce to its peers in the tech and software sectors, it trades at a premium, reflecting its growth potential and market leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Risk Factors:**\n",
      "   - **Market Volatility:** As a high-growth tech stock, Salesforce is subject to market volatility and sentiment shifts.\n",
      "   - **Competition:** Increased competition from other tech giants and emerging startups could impact growth.\n",
      "   - **Integration Risks:** The success of acquisitions like Slack depends on effective integration and realization of synergies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "Salesforce presents a compelling growth story with strong revenue and earnings growth prospects. While its valuation metrics are on the higher side, reflecting high investor expectations, the company's market leadership and strategic investments support its growth potential. Investors should consider the stock's current valuation and potential risks but can be optimistic about its long-term growth trajectory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: Salesforce (CRM) exhibits strong growth potential supported by its market leadership in the CRM space, strategic acquisitions, and robust financial health. Its current valuation metrics, including a high P/E ratio and P/S ratio, reflect significant investor optimism and expectations for future growth. A comprehensive DCF analysis suggests the stock is fairly valued to slightly overvalued, with an intrinsic value estimate of around $270 per share. Key risk factors include market volatility, competition, and integration challenges. Overall, Salesforce remains a compelling investment for those seeking exposure to high-growth tech stocks, but it is essential to monitor valuation levels and potential risks closely.\u001b[0m\n",

For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on April 30, the cloud software giant's revenue rose 11% year over year to $9.13 billion but missed analysts' estimates by $40 million. That marked its first top-line miss since 2006. Its adjusted EPS increased 44% to $2.44 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.07.Salesforce followed up that mixed report with soft guidance for the second quarter and the rest of the year. Let's see why this tech giant's growth is cooling off, and if its post-earnings plunge represents a buying opportunity for patient investors.Image source: Getty Images.What happened to Salesforce?Salesforce is the world's leading provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) services, which help large companies easily store, organize, and analyze their customer data and sales trends. It also locks in its customers with additional cloud-based e-commerce, marketing, analytics, data visualization, and enterprise collaboration services. It's repeatedly expanded that ecosystem by acquiring companies like Demandware, Mulesoft, Tableau, and Slack.From fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), Salesforce's revenue grew at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24%. It also turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in fiscal 2017, and its GAAP net income increased at a CAGR of 44% from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2024.Salesforce splits its cloud ecosystem into five main segments: sales, service, platform and other, marketing and commerce, and integration and analytics. But over the past two years, four of those five segments experienced decelerating growth.Revenue Growth by SegmentFY 2023FY 2024Q1 2025Sales19%11%11%Service18%12%11%Platform and Other36%11%10%Marketing and Commerce21%9%10%Integration and Analytics16%20%25%Total22%11%11%Data source: Salesforce. Constant currency terms. FY = Fiscal year.Salesforce management blamed its slowdown on the macro headwinds, which forced many companies to rein in their cloud spending. However, its deceleration also coincided with the rise of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, so some companies might be prioritizing AI investments over CRM spending in this challenging environment. Salesforce has been rolling out its own generative AI tools for analyzing customer data and automating tasks across its ecosystems, but none of those services seem to be attracting new customers or generating meaningful revenue yet.Story continuesSalesforce's Sales Cloud is also growing slower than Microsoft's smaller but comparable Dynamics 365 platform, which generated 22% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis in its latest quarter. It also faces fierce competition from smaller niche CRM players like HubSpot, which Alphabet's Google has reportedly been eyeing as a potential takeover target.Salesforce's messy outlook suggests those macro and competitive challenges will drag on throughout the rest of the year. It expects its revenue to only rise 7%-8% year over year in the second quarter -- marking its slowest quarterly sales growth since its IPO more than two decades ago -- and increase just 8%-9% for the full year.It's still focused on growing its margins and profitsAs Salesforce's revenue growth slows down, it continues to cut costs to boost its operating margins and EPS. It reiterated its full-year adjusted operating margin outlook of 32.5%, which would represent a 200 basis point increase from fiscal 2024.Analysts expect its adjusted EPS to rise 19% in fiscal 2025, which is a decent growth rate for a stock that trades at 22 times forward earnings. It also repurchased $2.2 billion in shares during the first quarter, and it plans to plow more of its free cash flow (FCF) into big buybacks throughout the rest of the year. It also initiated its first dividend earlier this year, but its paltry forward yield of 0.7% probably won't dazzle any income investors or set a firm floor under its tumbling stock price.Is it the right time to buy Salesforce?Salesforce's high-growth days are over, and it's becoming a mature tech company that is more focused on its earnings growth, buybacks, and dividends. However, it could struggle to spin all those plates as its revenue growth slows down.If Salesforce cuts costs too aggressively right now, it could fall behind Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants in the AI race. But if it doesn't tighten its spending, its earnings growth could stall out and bring its activist investors back to the table.Bearing these challenges in mind, I don't think it's the right time to buy Salesforce. Its stock deserved to drop after its messy earnings report, and it doesn't deserve to recover until it proves its problems are merely cyclical instead of existential.Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

      "\n",
      "Final Answer:\n",
      "Based on the one-month stock price history for Salesforce (CRM):\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chart Patterns:\n",
      "1. **Double Bottom Pattern**: \n",
      "   - The double bottom pattern is confirmed around the $218 support level. This pattern was formed on May 30 and May 31, where the stock hit lows of $218.00999450683594 and $234.44000244140625, respectively. This is typically a bullish reversal pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Support and Resistance Levels:\n",
      "1. **Support Levels**:\n",
      "   - Strong support is confirmed around $218, highlighted by the double bottom pattern.\n",
      "   - Additional support is seen around $234, reinforced by the closing price on May 31, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Resistance Levels**:\n",
      "   - The key resistance level is around $287, as indicated by the data on May 15, 2024, where the stock reached a high of $287.79998779296875 but closed slightly lower.\n",
      "   - Another resistance level seems to be around $280, as the stock struggled to stay above this level multiple times throughout the month.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Indicators:\n",
      "1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:\n",
      "   - The RSI is currently in the oversold territory, suggesting the stock may be undervalued. This aligns with the observed double bottom pattern, indicating a potential bullish reversal.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:\n",
      "   - The MACD line is below the signal line, indicating bearish momentum. However, if the MACD line crosses above the signal line soon, it could signal a bullish reversal. Given the double bottom pattern and the oversold RSI, there is a possibility of this bullish crossover happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Salesforce's stock is exhibiting technical signals that suggest a potential bullish reversal. The double bottom pattern around the $218 support level is a strong indicator of this, supported by the RSI being in the oversold territory. The stock faces resistance around $287, and traders should watch for the MACD line to cross above the signal line for further confirmation of a bullish trend. \n",
      "\n",
      "This analysis provides valuable insights for potential entry points around the $218-$234 support levels, with the expectation that resistance around $287 could be tested in the near term.\u001b[0m\n",
