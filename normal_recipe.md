2. Add the cubed feta cheese and kalamata olives.
3. Drizzle with olive oil and red wine vinegar.
4. Sprinkle with dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
5. Toss gently to combine. Set aside to let the flavors meld.

**Main Course: Moussaka**
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Lay the eggplant slices on a baking sheet, brush with olive oil, and roast for 20 minutes until tender.
3. In a large skillet, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sauté until translucent.
4. Add ground beef or lamb, cook until browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, allspice, and red wine (if using). Simmer for 15-20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. In a saucepan, melt 3 tbsp of butter over medium heat. Stir in flour, cooking for 1-2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, cooking until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese, beaten eggs, and nutmeg.
6. In a baking dish, layer half of the roasted eggplant, followed by the meat sauce, then the remaining eggplant. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top.
7. Bake for 30-40 minutes until the top is golden brown.

**Dessert: Baklava**
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a bowl, combine chopped walnuts and cinnamon.
3. Brush a 9x13 inch baking dish with melted butter. Lay a sheet of phyllo dough, brush with butter. Repeat with 8 sheets.
4. Spread a layer of the walnut mixture. Add another 8 sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, ending with 8 sheets of phyllo.
5. Cut the baklava into diamond shapes with a sharp knife.
6. Bake for 50 minutes until golden and crisp.
7. In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, honey, vanilla extract, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes.
8. Pour the cooled syrup over the hot baklava. Let it soak in and cool before serving.

#### Serving Suggestions:

- **Greek Salad**: Serve the salad in individual bowls or family-style in a large serving bowl. Garnish with a few extra olives and a sprinkle of oregano for a fresh look.
- **Moussaka**: Let the Moussaka rest for 10 minutes after baking to firm up. Serve generous portions with a side of crusty bread and a simple green salad.
- **Baklava**: Serve the baklava pieces on a decorative platter. For an added touch, sprinkle with a few extra chopped walnuts or a light dusting of powdered sugar.

Enjoy your delicious Greek dinner with friends and family!
