#### Preparation Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

6. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the milk, cook until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and stir in the nutmeg and Parmesan cheese. Let cool slightly and whisk in the beaten eggs.
7. In a baking dish, layer half of the eggplant slices, followed by the meat sauce, then the remaining eggplant slices. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top.
8. Bake for 45 minutes until the top is golden and bubbly. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving.

#### Serving Suggestions:

3. Unroll the phyllo dough and cut it to fit the baking dish. Cover with a damp cloth to keep from drying out.
4. Place two sheets of phyllo dough in the baking dish, brush with melted butter. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered.
5. Sprinkle a thin layer of the nut mixture over the phyllo. Cover with two more sheets of phyllo, brush with butter, and repeat layering the nuts and phyllo until all the nuts are used. Top with 6-8 sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter.
6. Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes.
7. Bake for 50 minutes until golden and crisp.
8. While the baklava is baking, combine the sugar, water, honey, vanilla extract, and lemon zest in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.
