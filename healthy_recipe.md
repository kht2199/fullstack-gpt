### Vegetarian Moussaka (Main Course)

#### Ingredients:

**For the Lentil-Mushroom Mixture:**
- 1 cup green or brown lentils, rinsed
- 2 cups water or vegetable broth
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups mushrooms, finely chopped (cremini or button mushrooms work well)
- 1 large carrot, finely diced
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup red wine (optional)
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped

**For the Eggplant:**
- 2 large eggplants, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
- Salt
- Olive oil for brushing

**For the Béchamel Sauce:**
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups milk (dairy or plant-based)
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or a vegetarian alternative)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten

#### Preparation Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Eggplant:**
   - Lay the eggplant slices on a baking sheet and sprinkle both sides with salt. Let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out excess moisture and bitterness. Rinse and pat them dry with a paper towel.
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Brush the eggplant slices with olive oil on both sides and place them on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they are golden brown and tender. Set aside.

2. **Cook the Lentils:**
   - In a medium saucepan, combine the lentils and water or vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but not mushy. Drain and set aside.

3. **Prepare the Lentil-Mushroom Mixture:**
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic and sauté until they are soft and translucent.
   - Add the chopped mushrooms and carrot to the skillet and cook until the mushrooms release their moisture and begin to brown.
   - Stir in the cooked lentils, cinnamon, allspice, dried oregano, and dried thyme. Cook for another 2-3 minutes to blend the flavors.
   - Add the diced tomatoes (with their juice), tomato paste, and red wine (if using). Simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens. Season with salt, pepper, and fresh parsley. Set aside.

4. **Make the Béchamel Sauce:**
   - In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for about 1-2 minutes until it forms a smooth paste (roux).
   - Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Continue to cook until the sauce thickens and comes to a simmer.
   - Remove from heat and stir in the ground nutmeg and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Allow the sauce to cool slightly, then whisk in the beaten eggs.

5. **Assemble the Moussaka:**
   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - In a large baking dish, layer half of the roasted eggplant slices on the bottom.
   - Spread the lentil-mushroom mixture evenly over the eggplant.
   - Top with the remaining eggplant slices.
   - Pour the béchamel sauce over the top, spreading it out evenly with a spatula.

6. **Bake the Moussaka:**
   - Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the sauce is set.
   - Allow the Moussaka to cool for about 15-20 minutes before serving. This will help it set and make it easier to cut into portions.

#### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve the vegetarian Moussaka warm, garnished with a sprinkle of fresh parsley.
- It pairs wonderfully with a simple Greek salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, olives, and feta cheese).

### Baklava (Dessert)

#### Ingredients:
- 1 package (16 oz) phyllo dough, thawed
- 2 cups chopped nuts (walnuts, pistachios, or a mix)
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 cup butter, melted
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest

#### Preparation Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. In a bowl, combine the chopped nuts and ground cinnamon.
3. Unroll the phyllo dough and cut it to fit the baking dish. Cover with a damp cloth to keep from drying out.
4. Place two sheets of phyllo dough in the baking dish, brush with melted butter. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered.
5. Sprinkle a thin layer of the nut mixture over the phyllo. Cover with two more sheets of phyllo, brush with butter, and repeat layering the nuts and phyllo until all the nuts are used. Top with 6-8 sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter.
6. Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes.
7. Bake for 50 minutes until golden and crisp.
8. While the baklava is baking, combine the sugar, water, honey, vanilla extract, and lemon zest in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.
9. Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour the hot syrup over it. Let cool completely before serving.

#### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve pieces of Baklava with a dollop of Greek yogurt or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
- Garnish with a sprinkle of chopped nuts or a drizzle of honey.
