#### Latest News:
**Leo Sun, The Motley Fool - Mon, Jun 3, 2024**

Salesforce's stock price plunged 20% on May 30 after the company released its latest earnings report, marking its steepest one-day decline in 20 years. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on April 30, Salesforce's revenue rose 11% year over year to $9.13 billion but missed analysts' estimates by $40 million. This marked its first top-line miss since 2006. Its adjusted EPS increased 44% to $2.44 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.07.

Salesforce followed up that mixed report with soft guidance for the second quarter and the rest of the year. The company expects its revenue to rise 7%-8% year over year in the second quarter, marking its slowest quarterly sales growth since its IPO more than two decades ago, and increase just 8%-9% for the full year.

Salesforce's revenue growth slowdown is attributed to macroeconomic headwinds, which forced many companies to rein in their cloud spending, and rising competition from generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Salesforce has been rolling out its own generative AI tools, but these services have not yet attracted significant new customers or revenue.

Additionally, Salesforce's Sales Cloud is growing slower than Microsoft's comparable Dynamics 365 platform and faces fierce competition from smaller CRM players like HubSpot. 

Despite these challenges, Salesforce continues to focus on growing its margins and profits. The company reiterated its full-year adjusted operating margin outlook of 32.5%, representing a 200 basis point increase from fiscal 2024. Analysts expect its adjusted EPS to rise 19% in fiscal 2025.

#### Market Sentiment:
The market sentiment towards Salesforce (CRM) has shifted negatively towards the end of May, likely due to disappointing earnings or increased competition, as indicated by the sharp decline in stock price on May 30. However, the partial recovery on May 31 suggests that some investors still see potential value in the stock at the lower price range, indicating a mixed but cautious sentiment. Key resistance levels are around $287, and new support levels are around $218-$234. Potential entry points for investors could be considered around these new support levels if the stock shows signs of stabilization.

#### Financial Insights:
Based on the latest news and the current market sentiment towards Salesforce, the stock performance in the near term might experience volatility and potential downside due to negative market sentiment and significant insider selling. However, in the medium term, if Salesforce continues its strong financial performance and effectively addresses competitive challenges, the stock could recover and perform well. Investors should monitor the company's quarterly results and strategic initiatives closely to make informed decisions.
